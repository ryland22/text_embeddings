Boris Johnson has become the second senior cabinet minister to quit within 24 hours, as Prime Minister Theresa May faces a growing political crisis over her Brexit strategy.

In his resignation letter, Mr Johnson said the prime minister was leading the UK into a "semi-Brexit" with the "status of a colony".

Brexit Secretary David Davis resigned on Sunday, saying he did not support a Brexit plan agreed by ministers on Friday.
