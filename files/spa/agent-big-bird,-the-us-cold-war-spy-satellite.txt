The Cold War saw an unprecented level of spying by the USA and the Soviet Union. While much of it was carried out by long-range spy planes such as the SR-71 Blackbird, there were other methods - one of which was beyond the reach of any air defence missile.

You could call it a Cold War equivalent to Google Earth - the spy satellite Hexagon, also known as Big Bird.
