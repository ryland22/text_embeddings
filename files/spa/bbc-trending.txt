American model and actress Chrissy Teigen has found herself in the middle of a social media storm again after posting this photograph with her children.

In a widely shared Instagram photo she is seen breastfeeding her baby along with her daughter Luna's doll.

The mother-of-two captions the image: "Luna making me feed her babydoll so I guess I have twins now."

In just one day, the post was liked nearly three million times on Instagram, and 18,000 times on Twitter.

But not all responses have been positive.
