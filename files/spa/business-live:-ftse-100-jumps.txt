If you were looking forward to extra services and capacity on the railways by the end of the year, think again.

Changes to timetables due to be made in December by CrossCountry, Govia Thameslink Railway, Great Western Railway, London Overground, Northern, South Western Railway, TransPennine Express and West Midlands Trains have been postponed following the chaos sparked by schedule alterations in late May.

A "more cautious approach" will be taken to ensure passengers can "plan their journeys with confidence", industry body the Rail Delivery Group said.

The government has "accepted the rail industry's recommended approach", the group added.

The announcement means returning to confirming timetables 12 weeks ahead will take longer than planned, and is now not expected to happen until May next year.
