Dassault is promoting its family of high-end Falcon business jets at the show, but the spotlight at this year’s event is on the recently launched 6X.

The programme was unveiled in February, two months after the French airframer axed its 5X predecessor, having run out of patience with Safran and its much delayed Silvercrest engine.

Scheduled for first flight in 2021, followed by certification and first delivery in 2022, the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW812D-powered 6X will share wings and most systems with the 5X but will be 51cm (20in) longer and adds 300nm (555km) of range, taking it to 5,500nm at Mach 0.80. Like the its ill-fated forerunner, the 6X features the largest cabin cross-section of any purpose-built business jet, at 198cm high by 258cm wide.

Speaking at the show earlier today, Dassault Aviation chief executive Eric Trappier said: “In the short months since its unveiling, we have presented the 6X to a wide range of potential buyers, and the reaction has been quite positive.”

The first firm sales followed shortly after the February announcement “and the number of ongoing negotiations makes me very optimistic about the success of this big new twinjet”, he said.
