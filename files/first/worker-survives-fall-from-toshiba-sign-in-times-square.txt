The worker who fell from the Toshiba sign in Times Square.

A worker took a tumble off the Toshiba sign in Times Square on Wednesday morning — miraculously landing on a ledge and escaping with only minor injuries, officials said.

The laborer slipped from his ladder while working on the iconic sign high above the Crossroads of the World around 10:50 a.m., authorities said.

He fell about 20 feet before landing on a narrow ledge approximately 20 stories off the ground, according to the FDNY.

About 35 first responders helped bring the laborer down safely.

The worker, whose identity wasn’t released, was taken to Bellevue Hospital with only minor injuries.

The electronic billboard — which has served as the backdrop of New Year’s Eve ball drops since 2007 — is being taken down as part of a cost-cutting measure by the Japanese electronics titan, according to The Nikkei Asian Review.
