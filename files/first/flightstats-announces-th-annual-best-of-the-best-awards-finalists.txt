Methodology

FlightStats collects real-time flight status information on over 90% of scheduled passenger flights flown by the top 250 airlines worldwide and archives that information in a historical flight database. In many regions FlightStats tracks more than 98% of scheduled flights enabling the company to provide comprehensive on-time performance information to the global travel community.

Data sources include airline direct operational data feeds, airline data via the world’s largest Global Distribution Systems (GDSs), civil aviation authorities, airports, positional data feeds, and other 3rd party data aggregators. Flight schedules from over 800 airlines worldwide are provided by Innovata, part of FlightGlobal.

A comprehensive set of historical data for the calendar year 2016 was extracted from our historical flights database. Information was summarized by airline and included the number of scheduled flights, the number of flights that were successfully tracked, the number of flights that departed within 14 minutes of scheduled departure time (D14) and the number of flights that arrived within 14 minutes of scheduled arrival time (A14). For purposes of ranking and selecting the top-performing airline in each category, on-time arrival performance (A14) was used as the key metric. Any flight arriving the gate no later than 14 minutes after the scheduled arrival time is considered to be an on-time flight.

For a carrier to be included for analysis in any given category, several requirements must be met (unless otherwise noted):

1. The carrier must rank in the top 150 worldwide in terms of capacity (Available Seat Miles).

2. Data tracking coverage must exceed 90%, meaning that FlightStats has scheduled and actual gate arrival times on at least 90% of the scheduled flights for most categories. For the Global Airline category, the coverage threshold was set at 85%. The coverage threshold used for Latin America was 80% while coverage for the Middle East & Africa was 65%.

3. To be considered in the Global Airline category, an airline must have more than 1,000 scheduled flights in 3 or more geographic regions and more than 30,000 flights overall in 2016.

4. The Major Airline classification is based on the number of scheduled flights, the available seat kilometers (ASK) and the extent of an airline's network as measured by the number of destinations. A scoring algorithm is used to determine this designation.
