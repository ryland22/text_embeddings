Recent claims on Instagram that rap stars Eminem and Nicki Minaj have started dating have been thrown into question by new public statements that suggest it was all a joke.

On stage at a concert in Boston on Sunday, Eminem, 45, twice asked his audience "How many people in Boston want me to date Nicki Minaj?"

Much of the crowd yelled in the affirmative.

"Well Goddammit, me too," Eminem said, who proceeded to offer a few words for Minaj from the stage.

"Nicki, if you get this message, just text me later, we'll talk about it," he said.

Minaj, 35, who is responsible for sparking the dating speculation with an Instagram post last week, soon responded to Eminem's Boston message.

LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. The fact that heâ€™s silly & a goof just like meðŸ˜©. Love him so much. Em we need you on the #Queen album. Thatâ€™s where our 1st date will be; at the studio while I gaze into ur beautiful eyes as u write ur verse. ðŸ˜­ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ https://t.co/iFYi0OlzXQ â€” Chun-Li (@NICKIMINAJ) May 28, 2018

In a lighthearted Twitter post that she peppered with emoticons, Minaj laughed at Eminem's shout out and declared that he is "silly & a goof just like me. Love him so much."

But the same post then called into question the seriousness of her earlier dating claim. The tweet said to Eminem that "we need you" on her forthcoming Queen album, set to drop in August, and added that "that's where our 1st date will be; at the studio while I gaze into ur beautiful eyes as u write ur verse."

As of Monday afternoon, neither of the entertainers' social media accounts offered any additional insights into the alleged dating relationship.

Last week, Minaj responded on social media with a "yes" answer for a fan who asked whether she and Eminem were dating.
