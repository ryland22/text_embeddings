A 19-year-old man accused of holding up a Naperville gas station with the help of two accomplices has been charged with armed robbery with a firearm and aggravated robbery, officials said.

Robert Hill, of Carol Stream, and two other suspects — all wearing masks — went into a Speedway gas station in Naperville on Oct. 15 and struck a clerk in the back of the head with a gun, according to a news release from DuPage County State’s Attorney Robert Berlin and Naperville Police Chief Robert Marshall.

They then took money from the cash register and the clerk’s iPhone before locking him in a back room and fleeing, the release said.

Hill was taken into custody Tuesday when he appeared at the DuPage County Courthouse on another matter, the release said.

“It is alleged Mr. Hill and two other individuals entered the Speedway gas station, pistol whipped an innocent man who was just trying to make an honest living and then stole money from the business and the victim’s iPhone,” Berlin said.

“Thankfully the victim was not seriously hurt during this traumatic event. Thanks to the outstanding work of the Naperville Police Department that Mr. Hill was identified identified as a suspect in this case and charged.”

Hill is being held in the DuPage County jail in lieu of $500,000 bond. His next court appearance is scheduled for June 25.
