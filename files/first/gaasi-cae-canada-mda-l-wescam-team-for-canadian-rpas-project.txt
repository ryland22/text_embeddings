The CAF needs a MALE remotely piloted aircraft capability

General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc (GA-ASI) announced on 29 May it is teaming with CAE Canada; MacDonald, Dettwiler, and Associates (MDA); and L3 Wescam to pursue the Canadian Armed Forces’ (CAFs’) medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) project.

The team will offer GA-ASI’s MQ-9B SkyGuardian; a 5,700 kg gross takeoff weight aircraft with over 40 hours of un-refuelled mission endurance. CAE spokesperson Chris Stellwag said CAE would have overall responsibility for training systems and services and in-service support.
