CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Bales of cardboard caught fire Wednesday at a recycling center on Cleveland's West Side.

The fire started shortly after 1 p.m. at Royal Oak Recycling on Industrial Lane near West 160th Street and Industrial Parkway in Cleveland, fire department spokesman Lt. Mike Norman said.

Fire investigators believe a piece of paper became stuck in a forklift and caught fire. The fire then spread to bales of compressed cardboard, which are 4 feet tall, 4 feet wide and 6 feet long, Norman said.

Water is causing the bales to collapse, so crews are using skid-steer loaders to sift through the debris, he said.

Temperatures around 85 degrees caused Cleveland EMS to transport two firefighters to area hospitals for treatment, Norman said. A third firefighter was evaluated at the scene but cleared to return to duty, he said.

"Hot conditions today," Norman said. "Very, very difficult, challenging conditions to fight a fire in."

The flames were mostly contained to the exterior of the building, but did cause some damage inside the recycling center, Norman said.

Smoke from the fire was visible from Interstate 480.

Firefighters were still working to contain the flames just before 3 p.m.

Royal Oak Recycling is a commercial recycling company with locations across the Great Lakes region, according to the company's website.
