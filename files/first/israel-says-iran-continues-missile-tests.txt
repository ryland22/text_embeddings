Iran carried out previously unreported ballistic missile tests in January that contravened UN Security Council Resolution 2231, according to Israeli ambassador to the UN Danny Danon.

“Last January they launched a Shahab-3 and a ‘Scud’ variant: both capable of delivering nuclear payloads hundreds of km from Iran,” Danon said on his Twitter account on 24 May. “The international community must hold the Iranian regime accountable and stop their attempts to threaten our region.”

Israeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post reported on the same day that Danon had submitted a letter to the Security Council that reported the launches.

“On 2 January 2018, Iran launched a Shahab-3 variant at the Chabahar firing range,” the newspaper quoted the letter as saying.
