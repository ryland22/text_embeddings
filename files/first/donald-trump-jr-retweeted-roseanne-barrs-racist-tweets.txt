Donald Trump Jr. retweeted some of the offensive tweets posted by Roseanne Barr before her show was canceled Tuesday — calling billionaire George Soros a Nazi “who turned in his fellow Jews.”

After falsely claiming that Chelsea ​Clinton ​is married to Soros’ nephew, Barr responded ​with ​an “apology” that included a bizarre conspiracy-mongering rant about the Democratic donor — which the president’s son then relayed to his 2.84 million followers.

“Sorry to have tweeted incorrect info about you!I Please forgive me! By the way, George Soros is a nazi who turned in his fellow Jews 2 be murdered in German concentration camps & stole their wealth-were you aware of that? But, we all make mistakes, right Chelsea?” Barr wrote in the tweet.

The disgraced comedian then followed up with a second tweet, which was also retweeted by Trump Jr., saying: “Soros’ goal; the overthrow of us constitutional republic by buying/backing candidates 4 local district attorney races who will ignore US law & favor ‘feelings’ instead-and call everyone who is alarmed by that ‘racist’.”

Soros, a Jew, was 13 when the Nazis occupied ​his homeland ​Hungary, his spokesperson said Tuesday — calling Barr’s tweets an insult to Holocaust victims.

“He did not collaborate with the Nazis. He did not help round people up. He did not confiscate anybody’s property. Such false allegations are insulting to the victims of the Holocaust, to all Jewish people, and to anyone who honors the truth,” his rep said in a statement.

“They are an affront to Mr. Soros and his family, who against the odds managed to survive one of the darkest moments in our history.”

ABC cancelled its revival of “Roseanne” Tuesday after Barr spread the smears — and also compared former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to the “Planet of the Apes.”
