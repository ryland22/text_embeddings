Huge challenges face chemical companies as central bank stimulus comes to an end and markets return to supply and demand fundamentals.

You need a new road map that proposes alternatives for a new direction and gives answers about how to survive in today’s chaotic petrochemicals markets.

Scenario Study: Demand - The New Direction for Profit

This new Study by ICIS and the independent UK chemicals consultancy, International eChem, is the culmination of five years of ground-breaking forecasting work.

It has been developed by a team of experts who have many decades of industry experience in all the main product areas and geographies, and is under-pinned by data from the ICIS global Supply & Demand data analytics platform.

It enables you to examine the data and analysis underlying key trends and to see how our experts predict three very different potential scenarios will play out for petrochemicals markets.

Guidance is also provided on how to correctly prepare, plan and pivot for different crude oil price scenarios, and to identify major new revenue and profit growth opportunities in the petrochemical value chain.

The Study is delivered via the ICIS online platform. It includes detailed graphs and a full pack of data covering the 3 potential core oil price scenarios ($25, $50, $100/bbl) and each scenario’s impact on the ethylene, propylene, butadiene, paraxylene, and benzene value chains.
