Otto Olaf, Siemens head of eAircraft sales and development, and George Bye, founder of Bye Aerospace, shake on Bye's deal for Siemens electric motors in the Sun Flyer 2.

Bye Aerospace and Siemens will collaborate on future development of Bye Aerospace’s all-electric Sun Flyer 2, which made its maiden trip aloft this spring and is expected to begin certification flight trials soon.

“We are pleased to announce an agreement with Siemens to provide the electric propulsion motor and inverter for the Sun Flyer program,” said George Bye, CEO of Bye Aerospace. “They will be an active partner through the FAA certification and production phase for the Sun Flyer 2.”

Bye said the Sun Flyer family of aircraft, including the 2-seat Sun Flyer 2 and the 4-seat Sun Flyer 4, aim to be the first FAA-certified, U.S.-built practical, all-electric airplanes to serve the flight training and general aviation markets. Siemens will provide the SP70D motor with a 90kW peak output (equivalent to 115 hp), and a continuous rating of 70kW (90 hp).
