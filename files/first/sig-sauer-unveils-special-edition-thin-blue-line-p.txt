Firearms maker Sig Sauer unleashed a new P320 pistol styled in a Thin Blue Line motif for the National Association of Police Equipment Distributors.

The special edition Thin Blue Line P320 will be available starting June 8 with the limited run ending in early December. The Thin Blue Line P320 is a 9mm, modular, carry size pistol with SigLite Night Sights. The pistol sets itself apart by adorning itself with a Thin Blue Line flag, honoring law enforcement officers.

“It’s an honor for all of us here at Sig Sauer to serve our law enforcement community, and it’s humbling to earn the trust of police departments across the country through the selection of our firearms as their official duty sidearm,” Tom Jankiewicz, Executive Vice President of Law Enforcement Sales with Sig Sauer, said in a news release. “The Thin Blue Line Flag is a powerful image that evokes emotion. We felt that by creating this Special Edition Thin Blue Line Sig Sauer P320 Carry-size pistol, in partnership with NAPED, was a compelling tribute to honor the fallen, and the sacrifices being made every day by our men and women in blue.”

The Thin Blue Line series is only available to law enforcement officers through NAPED.

“More and more law enforcement agencies across the country are choosing the Sig Sauer P320 as their standard duty pistol due to its modularity, dependability, and accuracy,” said Tim Brown, President of NAPED and GT Distributors. “Sig Sauer’s commitment to the law enforcement community is unwavering, and we are proud to participate in this very important and meaningful partnership with an associate member of our organization.”

NAPED is a non-profit focused on providing strong business relationships, resources, products and services to the police community.
