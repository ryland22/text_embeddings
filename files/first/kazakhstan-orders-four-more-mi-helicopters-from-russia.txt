Kazakhstan has ordered four more Mil Mi-35M (‘Hind-E’) combat helicopters from Russia, according to a 29 May statement by the TASS news agency.

“A new contract for four Mi-35 helicopters has been signed this year,” Vladimir Drozhzhov, the deputy head of Russia’s Federal Service for Military and Technical Co-operation, was quoted by the media outlet as saying, without giving any details about the value of the contract or the expected delivery date of the platforms.

As all Mi-24s are understood to have been withdrawn from service, the Kazakhstan Air Defence Forces are quickly moving to address the gap in rotary-wing combat capability by obtaining Mil Mi-35M platforms. According to Jane's World Air Forces , the first four Mi-35s were delivered to Kazakhstan in late 2016, with another four scheduled for arrival by the end of 2018 as part of a contract signed with Russian Helicopters in 2017.

The recent announcement comes after Kazakhstan ordered another batch of Sukhoi Su-30SM multirole fighters from Russia during the KADEX 2018 defence exhibition in Astana, with the TASS news agency quoting Yuri Slyusar, the president of Irkut Corporation’s parent company, United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), as saying that the deal is for the delivery of eight Su-30SM platforms.

According to TASS, the Central Asian country also ordered a battalion of Buk-M2E self-propelled surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems during the exhibition.
