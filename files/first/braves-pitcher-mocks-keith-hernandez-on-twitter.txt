Perhaps Brandon McCarthy would have liked a video of Hadji better.

The Braves pitcher took exception to a tweet from Keith Hernandez criticizing his teammates in the bullpen after the Mets’ doubleheader Monday in Atlanta. Hernandez, who was in the broadcast booth for SNY, tweeted that the second game was “horrific” and pointed to the Braves’ bullpen.

“Typical, young, unpolished relievers being asked to throw breaking balls and change ups when they can’t,” Hernandez tweeted. “Asking too much. They should be in the minor leagues attempting to hone their skills. Big reason for 3 hour plus games. Walks and 3-2 counts. Not major leaguers. I’m talking about the Braves’ bullpen. If that’s what they got, they’re in big trouble.”

McCarthy, the major-league veteran who started the nightcap for the first-place Braves, shot back.

“When you didn’t read the book but have to give a book report,” McCarthy wrote while quote-tweeting Hernandez’s take.

Hernandez’s Twitter account has received widespread praise in recent weeks, as he has become a frequent poster on social media.

The Braves’ bullpen only walked two batters in the second game, both by 24-year-old Lucas Sims, but it was 24-year-old A.J. Minter who got tagged for three runs on four hits in 2/3 of an inning, allowing the Mets to come back and win it 8-5.

The doubleheader featured a nearly three-hour rain delay for the nightcap, which started around 10 p.m., after the Braves won the opener 4-3.
