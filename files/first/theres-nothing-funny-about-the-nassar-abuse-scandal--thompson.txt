Yes, there are times when humor is highly inappropriate. And a discussion about the $500 million settlement in the Larry Nassar abuse scandal is one of those times.

Earlier this week, veteran Michigan political journalist Tim Skubick asked former Michigan governor and current Michigan State University interim President John Engler where the university would find the money to pay the $500 million settlement reached with survivors of Nassar.

Engler responded that perhaps MSU could "...find a leprechaun."

Bad response, bad form and bad taste for anyone, let alone someone leading a university struggling to restore its image and change a culture that contributed to horrific abuse.
