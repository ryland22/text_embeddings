Hollywood has the Oscar. Baseball has the MVP. The highest accolade awarded to a recreational boat is Boating’s Boat of the Year.

To make the cut, a boat must be tested for a published review by a member of the Boating Tech Team during the year of contention. More importantly, the winning boat must set itself apart by exceeding — not just meeting — industry standards and by impressing us with attention to detail, the subtleties of ride and performance, and the benefits of amenity and aesthetics.

Then, locked away in private debate, we judge the contenders by how they compare with other boats in the same category. The boat that stands out in its category, more than any other boat stands out in any other category, wins the coveted prize.

This year, Boating is proud to bestow the honor of 2014 Boat of the Year upon Chris-Craft’s Launch 36.
