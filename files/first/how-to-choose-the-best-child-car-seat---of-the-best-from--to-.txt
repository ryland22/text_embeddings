By law your child must use a car seat until 12 years of age, but picking the right one for your pride and joy can be difficult with so many options on the market. To help you decide, we’ve rounded up some of the best child car seats currently available.

If you have a baby on the way, you’ll need a car seat to take your newborn home. However, baby car seats are only designed to last until around one year of age, meaning you’ll soon need to start looking at child car seats.

Child car seats come in many shapes and sizes, but are categorised into various different groups. Group 0-1 seats, also called combination seats, are suitable from birth up until your child hits 18kg (around 4 years of age). These seats start off as rearward-facing and then convert into bigger, forward-facing seats as your child grows.

Group 0-1 seats are expensive though, meaning the most common seats in this category are known as Group 1. These seats are forward-facing, suitable from around 9 months up until 4 years of age, and are normally a cheaper alternative.

Child car seat categories

Group 0: Suitable from birth to 10kg (birth to 6-9 months)

Group 0+: Suitable from birth to 13kg (birth to 12-15 months)

Group 1: Suitable from 9kg to 18kg (9 months to 4 years)

Group 2: Suitable from 15kg to 25kg (4 years to 6 years)

Group 3: Suitable from 15kg to 36kg (4 years to 12 years)

Group 1-2-3 seats cover a much wider age range, usually from around 9 months right up until 12 years of age, and feature a higher back and a harness. Group 2-3 car seats are similar to Group 1-2-3, but are only suitable from 4 years of age as they come without a harness – instead you secure your child with the car’s adult seat belt.

• Child car seat and booster seat laws explained

Once you’ve decided what size child car seat to buy, you’ll also need to take into account how the seat will be fitted. Most Group 0-1 seats employ a modular base to connect to the ISOFIX points in your car, with the child seat then clipping securely into the base. This ensures that the seat is fitted correctly every time and also makes securing and removing the seat a simple and easy process.

If you’re buying Group 0-1, then i-Size compliance is also something to look out for. The new safety standard was introduced in July 2013 and it only applies to ISOFOX seats, but it does offer significantly improved side impact safety in the event of an accident.

Regardless of how you decide to fix your seat, it’s always best to drive to a shop beforehand and check that the one you want can actually fit. Most stores will happily give a free demonstration.

Read our list below for some of the best child car seats available right now…

Mothercare Boston

Price: Around £100

Category: Group 0-1

Weight: 7.83kg

ISOFIX: No

The Boston has its limitations, with the biggest drawback being the fact that it’s not ISOFIX compatible - the only way to secure the seat is with the car’s regular seat belt. That said, it’s one of the cheapest Group 0-1 car seats money can buy at around £100, plus it features four reclining positions (one rearward- and three forward-facing) and has padded head and body support cushions for younger babies.
