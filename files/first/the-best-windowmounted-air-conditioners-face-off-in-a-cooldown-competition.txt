Likes: At 5,450 Btu, this was the least powerful unit included in our test, but the results were on par with the 6,000 Btu models. The little Friedrich included a number of features similar to the other models, including a 24-hour on/off timer, plus money-saver and dehumidifier settings. It also comes with an LCD remote control and EntryGard protection, which is a steel retaining wire that secures the chassis to the housing in order to deter all-too-common "kick-in" intrusions.

Dislikes: Despite paying a premium price for the Friedrich name, this model isn't Energy Star qualified, and bears an uncanny resemblance to the 6,000 Btu LG LW6014ER we also included in our test.
