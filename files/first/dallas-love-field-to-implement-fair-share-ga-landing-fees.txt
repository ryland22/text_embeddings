The City of Dallas says it’s time general aviation traffic using Love Field (DAL) begins paying its fair share of what it costs the city to operate the airport. Until a new policy begins July 1, general aviation operators pay for airport services through a fuel tax, a portion of which is directed back to the airport, while commercial airline traffic pay additional fees based on aircraft landing weight and their amount of airport usage.

That’s all changing on July 1 when the City of Dallas will add a new landing fee for general aviation operations, in addition to the fuel tax contribution, that Assistant City Manager Jody Puckett said in a statement could run as high as $5.80 per 1,000 pounds of aircraft weight. The city cited data captured between July 2016 and September 2017 as the premise behind the new fees. “GA aircraft landings represented 36% of the total number of aircraft landings,” while those aircraft accounted for just “10% of total aircraft landing weight.” The city added, “ … it has been our experience that most airfield O & M costs are affected by the volume of aircraft operations, regardless of aircraft weight.”

A City Council report last October looked closely at how much money various aircraft operators paid toward airport maintenance and concluded, “with the increasing air traffic at Dallas Love Field, the operations and maintenance costs are expected to increase.” Most importantly, the city decided, “general aviation users are not paying their fair share for airfield activity.”
