The new ASAP from Butler Creek loads magazines automatically with the touch of a button.

If you absolutely hate loading magazines by hand, well this is the day you’ve been waiting for.

Butler Creek has announced it will debut a new electronic magazine loader at the upcoming NRA Annual Meeting in Dallas, Texas.

The company says its new ASAP Electronic Magazine Loader automatically orientates loose ammunition and loads it into empty magazines. You just dump up to 60 rounds into the hopper, select the desired round count you want loaded into each mag, insert the mag, and press a button.

Butler Creek says the ASAP is the first of it’s kind on the market and that it was designed with competitive shooters and training facilities in mind, but if you burn through a whole lot of ammo during a range session, this might be for you too.

“The new Butler Creek Electronic Magazine Loader is on the cutting edge,” William Hemeyer, Butler Creek Senior Product Manager, said in a press release. “The new Electronic Magazine Loader represents our commitment to exceeding the expectations of accessory products used for magazine loading. For those looking for a fast and easy way to load rounds, the Butler Creek Electronic Magazine Loader is the perfect choice.”

It looks like the ASAP will only be for AR-style magazine for now and a price has not yet been announced.
