IAP Worldwide Services Inc. was awarded a contract for satellite systems.

The contract award from U.S. Army Contracting Command enables the company to provide "Satellite Baseband Systems satellite communications infrastructure" under a contract modification valued at more than $31.9 million, the Department of Defense announced on Thursday.

Satellite Baseband Systems satellite communications infrastructure provides the military with greater command and control over tactical and intelligence operations by improving significantly the communications between combatant commanders, ground forces and air assets.

Work on the contract will occur in Cape Canaveral, Fla., and is expected to be complete in May 2019.

More than $11.2 million will be obligated to IAP Worldwide Services at time of award from Army fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation, and operations and maintenance funds, the Pentagon said.
