#4 Bellarmine 37, #18 Serra 34

Bellarmine point guard Angelo Athens had never air-balled a free throw or made a game-winning buzzer-beater in his life. On Wednesday night, he did both of those things in the span of just a few minutes.

Athens missed the rim entirely on the first of two failed free throws with 2:20 remaining and host Serra protecting a 33-29 lead. Serra stretched that lead to 34-29 with 1:59 to go, but Bellarmine finally broke through in the closing moments.

An acrobatic tip-in by Kendall Stubblefield cut the Padres lead to 3, and moments later, Ike Ogbogu and Athens combined to force a turnover which led to a Jake Wojcik fastbreak layup and a foul. Wojcik converted the ensuing free throw, tying the game at 34 with 1:22 to play.

Serra’s first attempt to regain the lead was no good, but Masie Mohammadi’s offensive rebound gave the Padres a fresh 35. Bellarmine’s defense buckled down, forcing a shot clock violation with 10.1 seconds left.

The Bells tried to get Athens open in the corner, but Serra’s defense foiled the plan. Athens ended up receiving the ball from Wojcik on the wing, and the senior tried to dribble around a defender and heaved up a last-second off-balance shot. That prayer was answered as the shot rang off the backboard and fell through, giving Bellarmine (14-1, 5-0 WCAL) an improbable win.

Bellarmine remains tied for first in the WCAL with St. Ignatius (14-1, 5-0). The Wildcats picked up a 70-66 win at Mitty and will host Serra (8-7, 2-3) on Saturday. Jack Wilson, a 7-1 junior center, led the Padres with a game-high 11 points.

#6 St. Ignatius 70, #8 Mitty 66: Darrion Trammell had 19 points, Matt Redmond 16 and Jaedon Roberts and Teddy Snyder combined for 18 points as the visiting Wildcats won a nail-biter in San Jose. Down 1, St. Ignatius took the lead for good on a 3-pointer by Trammell.

Brandon Beckman had two big three-pointers down the stretch and sophomore Wrenn Robinson also had two big key buckets for the winners, helping to offset a big night from Riley Grigsby (28 points). Joseph Vaughan added 11 points and Mike Diaz 10 for Mitty (8-7, 3-2), which led by 10 points late in the second quarter.

But St. Ignatius rattled off seven quick points before the half and when Grigsby picked up his fourth foul early in the third, the Wildcats took control.

#1 Salesian-Richmond 82, El Cerrito 70: Two nights after struggling from the field, the top-ranked Pride (16-3, 2-0) got another big game from James Akinjo (21 points) and 18 points by Derrick Langford and 12 by Cameron Morgan to win their 10th straight. Kenneth Tims had 25 points, Tre Gray 15 and Tyler Dickson 10 for El Cerrito (7-11, 0-2). Akinjo was coming off a 29-point explosiong in a 45-36 win over St. John Bosco on Monday.
