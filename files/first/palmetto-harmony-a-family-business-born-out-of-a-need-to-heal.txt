When Janel Ralph gave birth to her daughter, Harmony, in 2009, she knew that it would change her life forever. What Janel didn’t know was that Harmony’s birth would alter her life in ways she never imagined.

Harmony was born with a rare genetic condition known as “smooth brain.” This condition produces myriad seizures which are considered untreatable by modern medicine. Janel was determined to find a treatment that would improve Harmony’s quality of life. That treatment was found in cannabinoid oils, as the therapeutic potential of cannabis and cannabinoids has become more apparent in the last few years. Thus, Palmetto Harmony was born.

In 2015, Janel founded the company Palmetto Synergistic Research LLC and created a product line named Palmetto Harmony. Palmetto Synergistic Research aims to produce full-spectrum, high-cannabinoid oils, the most cutting-edge products to improve quality of life. These oils are whole-plant hemp extract cannabidiol (CBD) oils.

Cannabis is a complex plant containing over 80 distinct cannabinoids, two of which are CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). While tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is the most popular phytocannabinoid due to its profound psychological impact, other cannabinoids have been gaining in popularity for much more practical reasons: they promote whole-body health without the “high.” In particular, CBD has been shown to promote endogenous cannabinoid system efficiency, reduce pain and inflammation, treat anxiety and depression, calm neurological disorders, promote restful sleep, and treat addiction. Researchers believe that because of its non-toxicity and lack of harmful side effects, the potential benefits CBD offers are undeniable. A study from 2013, published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, found that CBD acts as an anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antioxidant, and antipsychotic agent. This makes it a potential treatment for a multitude of medical issues.

Few cannabis discussions have generated as much discourse as the difference between CBD and hemp oils. On the surface, they appear to be the same thing and come from the same plant species. Hemp oil and CBD oil come from different strains of the Cannabis sativa plant, but hemp oil is derived from a strain with a low cannabinoid count, while CBD oil is derived from strains that can be found in local marijuana dispensaries.

Palmetto Harmony makes their products from the whole plant. This is because products based on a whole plant extract, rather than an isolated CBD, are more potent. To achieve the desirable results requires a lower dosage than when a CBD isolate is used. With Palmetto Harmony, people report relief using much less. This happens because of the extra compounds that remain in Palmetto Harmony that are otherwise removed in isolated or “pure” CBD oil.

But how do these products work? It’s due to the body’s endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS). ECS, named after the plant that led to its discovery and the receptors found in the brain, organs, connective tissues, and immune cells. In each tissue, the ECS helps to maintain a stable internal environment despite fluctuations in external environments. Cannabinoids promote a steady equilibrium at every level of biological life, which is why the oils work so well.

There are four different delivery routes for Palmetto Harmony products. The first is oral delivery, using the Palmetto Harmony Oil. The second is releasing CBD directly into the bloodstream by applying transdermal patches directly to the skin. The third is applying the product to target areas and allowing it to absorb into the surface layer of skin, but this won’t activate the ECS. The final way is vaping, which lets your lungs absorb the CBD and break into the blood-brain barrier for quick relief.

All Palmetto Harmony products are safe and fully tested by a third-party ISO-certified lab. The plants used in the product range are grown using 100 percent organic practices, and every batch is tested for not only cannabinoid content and terpenes (volatile unsaturated hydrocarbons), but also mold, heavy metals, microbials, herbicides, and residual solvents. Palmetto Harmony offers extensive customer service and free consultations upon request.

While Palmetto Harmony products haven’t been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration, and the products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent diseases, many users agree that their lives have been changed dramatically.

“My 13-year-old daughter Izzy has been taking Palmetto Harmony for several months now. She has a neurodegenerative disease that is terminal,” said online user Leslie. “Your product has reduced her seizure frequency and duration. It has reduced her terrible generalized dystonia. It has reduced the need for emergency seizure/dystonia medications, allowing her to be less sedated. In October, she was weaned completely off one of her anti-epileptic medications (that she has been on for 9 years) and she has ‘come back’ to us. She is visually tracking us, smiling and being more present again! Truly a miracle for us. I cannot thank you enough!”

Ross, another online user with Crohn’s Disease, agreed. “I used this and it took away my anxiety, and I can sleep through the night now. This stuff works great.”

And of course, the namesake of Palmetto Harmony, Harmony, has found relief through using the product her mother helped create. Harmony can now go days without any episodes and her pharmaceutical intake has been reduced by 90 percent. She is more alert and aware of her surroundings. There is even evidence that Harmony’s brain is now functioning in areas previously thought impossible because of her disorder. Janel’s business and products have saved Harmony’s life.
