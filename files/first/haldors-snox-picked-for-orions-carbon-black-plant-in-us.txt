Haldor Topsoe has secured a contract to install its sustainable emissions control technology, SNOX, in Orion Engineered Carbons’ carbon black production plant in Ivanhoe in Louisiana, US.

The sustainable flue gas cleaning technology SNOX does not consume any reagents and water, aside from ammonia for the NOx reduction.

Prior to selecting the technology, Orion carried out in-depth analyses of the technology since 2014, including visiting the existing Haldor Topsoe plants and testing the concept at one of its manufacturing facilities.



The technology will combine Haldor Topsoe’s SNOX system with Orion’s capabilities in carbon black and remove SOx, NOx and dust particles from tail gases at the plant.

Orion Engineered Carbons CEO Jack Clem said: “Orion is committed to environmentally friendly operation of its facilities.

“Orion’s SNOX plant is set to become fully operational by April 2021.”

“Our extensive research determined that the Haldor Topsoe SNOX system, suitably adapted by our technical teams over the last several years, was the most dependable and cost-effective means of meeting or exceeding the requirements we now face.”

Under the agreement, Haldor Topsoe will be responsible for offering engineering, licence, proprietary equipment, spare parts, catalyst, and future supervision tasks at the time of commissioning and start-up.

Orion’s SNOX plant is set to become fully operational by April 2021.

Additionally, Orion is planning to build a cogeneration facility at the Ivanhoe plant to use energy from the production process in a bid to supply electricity for the new control technology and the current manufacturing processes.

The company runs 14 global production sites and four applied technology centres, producing high-performance speciality blacks from gas, furnaces, lamps, thermal and other carbon varieties.
