The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) has provided an update for the UK’s top ten best-selling cars of 2018, having revealed the most recent registration figures for April.

As expected, the Ford Fiesta continues to top the chart having taken 7,811 registrations last month, 2,392 more than the Volkswagen Golf could muster in second place.

• New car sales increase in April 2018

April provided some good news for the industry as new car sales rose for the first time in 12 months, with UK car buyers purchasing 10.4 per cent more cars than they did in April 2017.

Experts have urged caution though: April 2017 provided a low baseline for car sales off the back of a strong March 2017, as customers sought to avoid new tax measures. Meanwhile, year-to-date figures for 2018 remain 8.8 per cent down on last year.

Petrol car sales grew by 38.5 per cent last month, although this was offset by the continued decline in diesel sales, which fell by 24.9 per cent year-on-year. Hybrid cars and EVs also enjoyed a boost with sizeable 49.3 per cent increase against April 2017, although these still only account for 5.6 per cent of the total market.

• Brexit offers “no advantages” to UK carmakers, say MPs

Last year proved to be a testing time for the car industry thanks to uncertainty over Brexit, the announcement of a non-electrified car sales ban for 2040, and the introduction of new VED road tax rates with more severe tariffs on emissions.

And while 2017 was still the third-biggest year in a decade for car sales, industry experts are fearing a further contraction in the market over the course of 2018.

So the Ford Fiesta remains the best-selling car in Britain, but which other models make up the top ten? Read on to find out, or check out last year’s results…

The Ford Fiesta finished 2017 as the best-selling car in the UK, and it’s carried on where it left of 2018 by outselling its closest rival by nearly 14,000 registrations to date. 7,811 new Fiestas hit the road in April, pointing towards yet another strong year for the ever popular supermini.

2. Volkswagen Golf - 26,685 registrations

Second in the final 2017 top ten standings, the Volkswagen Golf is second again in the April 2018 rankings having secured 5,482 registrations, although it trails the Fiesta above by quite some distance.

3. Nissan Qashqai - 21,171 registrations

Starting 2018 in fourth place, the Nissan Qashqai has managed to climb to third in the latest standings. In 2017 it was the most popular SUV in Britain, but the Vauxhall Mokka X stole an early march in the race for that title in the first two months of this year. Since then though, the Qashqai has reclaimed its crown with Mokka X sales having dwindled.

4. Ford Focus - 19,344 registrations

Not content with securing first place for April with the Fiesta, Ford also takes fourth position for April sales alone with the Ford Focus. 3,784 registrations in April have helped it maintain fourth overall, with strong interest being shown in new model due on the roads this September.

5. Vauxhall Corsa - 17,995 registrations

Vauxhall is a brand that desperately needs to show some promise in 2018, and 2,643 registrations of the Corsa in April have kept the car maker ticking over. It was fifth in the best-selling list last year, and Vauxhall will want to hang on to that position as it sorts out its future under PSA Group’s control…

6. Ford Kuga - 15,865 registrations

Another Ford in the top ten, ensuring there’s no place in the 2018 best-selling list for former regulars such as the Vauxhall Astra. Its boot might be a tad smaller than some rivals’, but lots of passenger space is a strong selling point.

7. Mercedes A-Class - 14,849 registrations

Scraping into the top ten overall in 2017, the Mercedes A-Class has hit the ground running in 2018, adding 2,636 registrations in April. The hatchback has made headlines recently with an all-new model being unveiled, ensuring continued strong interest in the car.

8. MINI – 14,297 registrations

After breaking into the top 10 best selling cars back in March, the MINI is now eighth overall for the year. Its distinctive styling and great driving dynamics are still managing to attract customers, although it didn’t make the top ten list for registrations in the month of April.

9. Vauxhall Mokka X - 13,579 registrations

Usually we get a few surprises in the early editions of the best-selling cars list, and the Vauxhall Mokka X provides the first of those by continuing to sell well in 2018. Outselling one of Vauxhall’s traditional best-sellers - the Astra – only time will tell if it’s able to maintain its place in the top ten…

10. Mercedes C-Class - 13,495 registrations

Ninth in the overall best-selling cars list in 2016 and 2017, once again the Mercedes C-Class creeps into the top ten in the first few months of 2018. Strong fleet sales have always aided the C-Class towards this end, and the German brand plans to capitalise on its popularity with a new model in the second half of the year. Keep your eyes peeled…
