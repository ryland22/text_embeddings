Anthony Scaramucci, back at his SkyBridge Capital hedge fund for just a month, is already drumming up new business.

The hedgie turned politico-for-a-minute turned hedgie once again, is close to landing a $30 million investment from the Korean Teacher’s Credit Union, The Post has learned.

While the investment is tiny compared to the $11 billion SkyBridge fund of funds, The Mooch, as the hedgie is known hopes the cash primes the pump before a strong Asian push later this year.

“Only back a month and starting the grind!” Scaramucci, who flamed out as White House Communications Director after 10 days, told The Post.

The credit union has already invested $55 million in SkyBridge’s $785 million Legion Offshore fund. KTCU expects to close the transaction on June 1.

“Strong performance” was the reason behind the increased investment, Scaramucci said, noting the fund’s 5.1 percent year-to-date performance.

Mooch’s SkyBridge is planning a tour through Asia soon after President Trump’s expected summer summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

SkyBridge will head to South Korea and Japan for a full-tour of the their respective asset management businesses.

The fund will also be going to China, where it will join up with Chinese-conglomerate HNA Group to market SkyBridge in China. It is an interesting pairing considering that until last month HNA was expected buy SkyBridge — until it didn’t.

The deal, which was announced in January 2017 as Scaramucci tried to work his way into a White House gig, was held up by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US. Ultimately both sides walked away from the deal after finding the Treasury-chaired panel’s conditions too restrictive.

“Despite the deal not going through, we are joint venturing in China with HNA,” Scaramucci said.
