Led by the dynamic Anna Throne-Holst, the Swedish-American Chamber of Commerce in New York is completing a deal to move to the full, 18,294-square-foot 29th floor of the Paramount Group’s 900 Third Ave.

Sources say the below-market, four-year sublease from Virtu Financial includes furniture, and the modern open plan has Central Park views.

The location will become its offices and a physical gateway for a new SACCNY platform to enhance its support of Swedish firms that want to expand or seek a foothold in America. According to its Web site, the offices will also provide members with low-cost space for networking, meet-ups, conference and events for all things Swedish.

Throne-Holst, the former Southampton supervisor who lost the congressional race against Rep. Lee Zeldin in 2016, was hired as the SACCNY president in March 2017.

Founded in 1906, the group includes major companies like Skanska, Volvo and SAS as well as individuals. But so far, sources said, Stockholm-based music behemoth Spotify hasn’t joined the local booster club.

The active Chamber also hosts events and major conferences around the world to support techies and startups, sustainability and women.

Nicholas Gilman, Gordon Ogden and Caxton Kaback of Byrnam Wood represented the SACCNY in the sublease and is marketing its current 3,580 square feet at 570 Lexington Ave. Byrnam Wood declined comment.

Virtu was represented by Michael Lenchner of Sage Realty along with the JLL team of Cynthia Wasserberger and Kristen Morgan, who either could not be reached or declined comment.

Virtu, a technology-honed publicly traded market maker completed a $1.4 billion acquisition of KCG Holdings in July 2017 and moved into its much larger offices at 300 Vesey St., aka One North End Ave.
