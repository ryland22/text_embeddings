A Naperville man who told police he placed women’s underwear along the Illinois Prairie Path in DuPage County as an experiment pleaded guilty Wednesday to a misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct.

William Winnie, 68, had been scheduled to stand trial in DuPage County court, but struck a last-minute plea deal with prosecutors. In exchange for his guilty plea, they dropped other counts Winnie was facing.

As part of the sentence, Winnie was ordered to perform 30 hours of community service, pay a $500 fine and spend a year on court supervision. During the year, he is barred from entering Pratt’s Wayne Woods.

It was in those woods, which are in the village of Wayne area, that police say Winnie had been leaving underwear packed in plastic bags, sometimes accompanied by salacious photos, near a pathway bridge.

In response to concerns expressed by trail users, the DuPage Forest Preserve police set up cameras to monitor the path. On Dec. 2, they apprehended Winnie as he collected underwear that had been placed near the bridge.

He reportedly told police that he would find the underwear during his bike rides through the preserve. Winnie would take the garments home, put them in plastic bags and then leave them along the trail. He described his actions as “an experiment to see where it goes,” according to police.

Winnie, who has no criminal record, declined to comment after his hearing.
