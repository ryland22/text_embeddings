This is a milestone year for Hamilton Watch. The Swiss company marks 100 years since it became the official timekeeper of the U.S. airmail flights between Washington, Philadelphia and New York City.

To mark the occasion, Hamilton has created a special timepiece that represents the watchmaker’s long and storied history in aviation — the Hamilton 2018 limited-edition Khaki X-Wind Auto Chrono.

Based on the original Khaki X-Wind, the 2018 edition includes new aviation-specific features for pilots (such as a drift-angle calculator handy for judging crosswind component) and is equipped with a silicon hairspring, meaning it should deliver the same level of performance many years from now as it does when new.
