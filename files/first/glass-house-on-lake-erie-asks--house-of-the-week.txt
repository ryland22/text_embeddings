BRATENAHL, Ohio -- If you live in a glass house, it might as well be on the lake.

The modern home on the shores of Lake Erie on Spring Bank Lane is both of things and more.

"Multiple floors of contemporary beauty with unobstructed lake views from every room," Chestnut Hill Realty's Craig Cantrall boasts. "The third-floor floating office over the second floor great room is just one of the unique and bold vibes this house offers."

The home, built on a third of acre in 1992, has 4 bedrooms and 2 1/2 bathrooms. New to the market, the asking price is $1,725,000.

That great room, which is accessed from a sweeping staircase or elevator on the first level, features a sleek fireplace, vaulted-ceiling atrium and light upon light coming in from the skylights and walls of windows.

The nearby kitchen has white cabinets and appliances, granite counters, island, hardwood floors and corner breakfast nook with a view.

The star of the interior, however, is the third level. The aforementioned floating office features skylights, exposed ductwork, a built-in bookshelf, gas fireplace and views that make it feel like you're working on top of Lake Erie.

Those views extend into the top-level master suite, which features a spa bathroom with mosaic tiled shower, large tub and double vanity.

The outdoor space includes a lakefront in-ground pool, patio, second-floor deck and lush landscaping.
