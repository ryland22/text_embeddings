Ft Collins, CO –-(Ammoland.com)- FBI goes with Glock!

According to a June 29, 2016, post from the General Services Administration, Glock has just been awarded a contract worth up to $85 million to supply handguns to the Federal Bureau of investigation.

After much testing, debating, hand-wringing, and all the rest that invariably goes along with major government contracts, the FBI has settled on the Glock pistol for issue to Special Agents, once again.

All this, after the SIG320, and some other competitors, looked so promising!

Not many additional details so far, other than it will be in 9mm, G17/19, and we are NOT calling it “Gen5!”

Friends familiar with the process tell me that extensive testing clearly revealed that no other pistol tested came close to Glock with regard to durability. Glocks run and run, and don’t break.

Lots of other find pistols can say the same thing, just not to the degree that Glock can!

Our armed services may be next!
