Easy. Just do what thousands of shooters do every year: treat your rifle so horribly that it must be replaced. Here’s how.

“Dear Dave,” read the e-mail, “I want to buy a new rifle but my wife says my present one is perfectly good and to quit whining. What should I do?”

1. Get hold of a can of oil and have at it.

Just as great chefs go heavy on the butter in just about everything, great gun wreckers slather on the lube. You can use a can of 10W30 or the latest miracle gun oil that is guaranteed not to gum, attract dirt, or go rancid. The results will be about the same.

2. If your rifle needs work, give it to your friend who will fix it for free.

This applies especially to trigger work, as amateur trigger jobs introduce the possibility of your killing someone, which makes shooting all the more exciting.

3. Do not wipe down your stainless-steel rifle.

The “stainless” steel used for rifle barrels and receivers is merely corrosion resistant. Water will rust it slowly. Blood, sweat, and other electrolytes will rust it quickly. Take your pick.

4. Store your rifle someplace where air cannot circulate around it.

Zipped up in a cheap vinyl soft case will do very nicely.

5. And if you really want to store it right, plug the barrel at both ends.

A big gob of sticky grease at the muzzle should trap all kinds of moisture-laden air.

6. Accumulate as much copper fouling as possible in the bore.

Bullets with pure copper jackets are especially good for this. A healthy coating of copper not only looks nicer than plain bare steel but will destroy your barrel’s accuracy and pit the bore for good measure.

7. While you’re at it, don’t clean the gun at all.

You have better things to do with your time. You do believe that guns don’t need cleaning if you shoot modern ammo, right?
