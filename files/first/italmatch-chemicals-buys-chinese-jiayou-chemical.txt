Italmatch Chemicals has acquired Chinese Jiayou Chemical from Ecolab for undisclosed amount.

The acquisition of the phosphonate manufacturer will enable Italmatch Chemicals to bolster its presence in the Asia-Pacific region.

The purchase of this location will complement the other facilities that Italmatch has in North America and Europe.



Italmatch Chemicals Group CEO Sergio Iorio said: “After closing 2017 with important acquisitions in North and Latin America, we are happy to begin 2018 with a very significant agreement for Italmatch Chemicals in Asia-Pacific.

“China is witnessing quick growth in industrial water and process water treatment.”

“Through this acquisition, Italmatch Chemicals achieves a global presence and a global market leadership in phosphonates, thanks to a new manufacturing presence in China.”

China is witnessing quick growth in industrial water and processed water treatment. The central government aims to improve the environmental standards of chemical companies. This objective is “fully aligned with Italmatch Chemical’s strategic objectives in the Asia-Pacific region.”

Set up in 1997, Italmatch Chemicals provides performance additives for water treatment, oil & gas, lubricants and plastics industries.

The company generates annual revenues of €400m and operates six manufacturing plants in Europe, four in Asia-Pacific, four in North America in addition to sales/distribution facilities across the world. It has around 700 employees.

Last December, Italmatch Chemicals acquired Detrex Corporation, a US-based an American company headquartered in Cleveland (Ohio), through its subsidiary The Elco Corporation.

Detrex is involved in the production of high performance lubricant additives for industrial applications and high purity hydrochloric acid.
