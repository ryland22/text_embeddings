UK-based INEOS Phenol has unveiled plans to build a Cumene unit in Germany to support customer demand and enhance security of supply for its plants in Gladbeck and Antwerp.

The company has started a front-end and engineering study (FEED) and is expecting to take a final investment decision by the end of this year.

Located within the Chemiepark in Marl, the new plant is scheduled to be complete in 2020.



INEOS Phenol CEO Hans Casier said: “We are very pleased to move forward with this important feedstock investment for our European business. It shows a clear commitment by INEOS to its Phenol business.

“The new plant will be an integral part of the northern Ruhr area Verbund structure.”

“The Marl Chemiepark has been selected as the best location to build a state-of-the-art, world-scale Cumene unit with excellent logistics that will underpin our phenol and acetone sites in Europe.”

The plant will use existing pipeline connections between INEOS’s Phenol & Acetone production site in Gladbeck, and the Evonik Chemiepark site in Marl.

Additionally, it will connect with the BP refinery and cracker complex in Gelsenkirchen, making it a fully integrated facility.

Chemiepark Marl site manager Dr Joerg Harren said: “We welcome INEOS’s decision to build the Cumene plant in the Chemiepark Marl as it underlines the attractiveness of the site.

“The site offers excellent infrastructure services such as flexible logistics and competitive energy and utilities supply for the chemical industry. The new plant will be an integral part of the northern Ruhr area Verbund structure.”
