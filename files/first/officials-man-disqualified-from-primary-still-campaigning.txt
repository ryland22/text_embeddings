A Maine man who was disqualified from the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate is still posting signs across the state declaring he is "Trump strong."

Bar Harbor financial planner Max Linn was disqualified from the Republican primary after Democratic Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap determined his nomination petition contained fraudulent signatures. The Portland Press Herald reports Linn's campaign confirmed Tuesday that it has been posting signs for the candidate, even though votes for Linn on June 12 will not be counted.

A state spokeswoman says any ballots cast for disqualified candidates will be counted as blanks. Linn's senate campaign Facebook page posted as recently as Tuesday, urging voters to turn out for Linn during the primary.

"When unelected bureaucrats and radical judges, given to us by the Democrats, tell us "no", we who support President Trump and are #TrumpStrong must unite and tell them "YES!'", the post read.

State transportation and ethics officials say Linn's campaigning doesn't appear to violate any election laws.
