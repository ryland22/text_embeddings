Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced a plan Wednesday to make free full-day pre-school available to all four-year-olds within four years, during a campaign-style event at Truman College.

The mayor turned his focus to early childhood education, with a scheduled sit-down interview at the school. It was Emanuel’s third in a series of policy speeches as he gears up to run for a third term.

The city plans to tap existing Chicago Public Schools funds to cover the cost of adding 3,700 pre-school seats this fall. And in three subsequent years, expansions will be paid for using new state money that’s expected to flow to Chicago’s schools as part of last year’s education funding deal in Springfield.

The costs to the cash-strapped Chicago Public Schools to provide the service to all four-year-olds whose parents want it would be about $175 million, Emanuel said. The figure includes capital improvements needed to make schools ready for pre-schoolers, as well as program changes, Emanuel said.

For Chicago families that often pay thousands of dollars annually for childcare and pre-kindergarten schooling, the chance to send a child to school at no cost for an extra year could prove a significant savings. It currently costs $13,974 to send a child to nine months of public preschool in Chicago.

Emanuel’s plan calls for 24,000 free public preschool seats by the 2021 school year, a figure based on U.S. Census data and the percentage of eligible pupils who were enrolled in full-day kindergarten when the city started offering it.

The mayor’s prior policy speeches this election cycle were on plans to expand the city’s Riverwalk and ways he plans to help small businesses.

For the mayor, it’s a chance to use the platform of incumbency to discuss big ideas without having to trade barbs directly with any of the nine challengers who have so far declared their intentions to try to unseat him in the 2019 municipal elections.
