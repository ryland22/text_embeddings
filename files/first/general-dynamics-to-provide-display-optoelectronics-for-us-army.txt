General Dynamics has been awarded a contract for display optoelectronics.

The deal, announced Friday by the Department of Defense, is valued at more than $13 million under the terms of a firm-fixed-price contract.

The press release indicates that the agreement is a 20-month supply contract with one option period that has been exercised at time of award.

The contract award from the Defense Logistics Agency enables General Dynamics to provide display optoelectronics, which the U.S. military is currently using to research the usefulness of soldiers using augmented reality and advanced micro-displays that pair with variant helmet mounts.

Work on the contract will occur in Michigan and Florida, and is expected to be complete in January 2020.

The allocations of funds will be derived from fiscal 2018 defense working capital funds, said the Pentagon press release.
