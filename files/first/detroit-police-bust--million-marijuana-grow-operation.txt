A distinct odor that caught the nose of a police officer led to a $1 million marijuana bust and six arrests Tuesday afternoon in Detroit.

Police found the large grow operation inside a warehouse on the 4400 block of West Jefferson, Detroit Police Officer Dan Donakowski said. Pictures taken inside the building show several dozen plants in various stages of growth.

It was the smell that originally tipped off authorities.

"Our motor patrol unit was conducting investigations in that area last week," Donakowski said. "They could smell what they thought was suspected marijuana."

He said the police department's gang intelligence unit, which includes a federal border patrol agent, went to the warehouse at about 3:40 p.m. Tuesday with a search warrant.

Donakowski said four men and two women were arrested. They range in age from 20 to 50 years old.

The investigation is ongoing.
