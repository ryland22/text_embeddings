Global chemical company BASF has teamed-up with technology company Farsoon to roll-out the new PA6 material solution for the 3D printing industry in China.

The BASF Ultrasint PA6 X043 Black will enable manufacturers to produce components with optimised shapes and lesser weight that can also endure harsh environment conditions.

Farsoon founder and chairman Dr Xu Xiao Shu said: “This new breakthrough in 3D printing materials makes direct manufacturing possible, which further accelerates the industrialisation of 3D printing in China.



“In the future, Farsoon will continue to work closely with BASF to help customers enhance their equipment and material performance, while reducing production costs. We aim to offer customers a true additive manufacturing solution.”

“BASF is dedicated to developing high-performance 3D printing materials such as the Ultrasint PA6 series.”

BASF noted that the new material will generate new possibilities for various industries such as aerospace, automotive and consumer.

Along with Farsoon’s new continuous additive manufacturing solutions (CAMS), including HT1001P, HT252P, ST252P, and HT403P, BASF’s Ultrasint PA6 X043 Black can help customers to develop performance components and increase productivity.

BASF 3D-Printing Asia-Pacific senior business development manager Michael Tang said: “BASF is dedicated to developing high-performance 3D printing materials like the Ultrasint PA6 series.

“We provide an open platform by working with our partners, such as Farsoon, to develop competitive 3D printing material solutions to realise future customer needs for mass production.”

At TCT Asia 2018 in Shanghai, China, BASF will showcase its new line of Ultrasint PA6 X043 Black material, along with the polymer powder bed fusion, made with the Farsoon’s CAMS technology.
