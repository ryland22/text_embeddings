That's how Bryan Harris, Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Everglades Boats , describes their impressive metal shop. While many boaters probably don't tie metal fabrication and welding to boatbuilding, the ability to customize parts and control the quality of that process makes it critical to how Everglades builds boats.

Everglades builds their boats to withstand some of the toughest boating conditions. Yes, the hull takes a pounding, but all of that energy also forces its way into the seat assemblies and hardtops. Thanks to the work done in the metal shop those pieces can take some brutal beating without failing.

Custom fabrication from design to welding gives Everglades the ability to build just about anything.

Everglades Boats employees are skilled craftsmen that take pride in building the best boat possible.

The next time you're admiring the fit and finish on an Everglades be sure to take a closer look at the metalwork. It might not be as flashy as the engines or electronics, but is every bit as important to the overall boating experience. That attention to detail in the metal shop helps produce a strongly built boat that ensures this "business within a business" remains successful for years to come.
