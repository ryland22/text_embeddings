Since the retro console's debut in 2016, the Japanese company has struggled to keep up with the overwhelming sales. By 2017, it had sold over 2 million units–rapidly outpacing Nintendo's previous console, the Wii U. “We just didn’t anticipate how incredible the response would be. Once we saw that response, we added shipments and extended the product for as long as we could to meet more of that consumer demand, ” said Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aimé, speaking to Time.

The popularity of the console speaks to the attention to detail that Nintendo gave it. With games like Super Mario Bros., Tecmo Bowl, and Kid Icarus, it offers a chance for old fan and younger explorers to look at world of gaming radically different than today's, which often revolve around bullets and blades. It even comes with a retro screen mode that will temporarily transform an HD TV into looking like a cathode-ray device from the 80s.

Of course, if you'd like to play some retro games right now and don't want to worry about shortages, there are several other retro devices out there. As for getting your hands on the Classic, good luck.
