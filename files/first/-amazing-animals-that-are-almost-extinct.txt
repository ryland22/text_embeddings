The Pinta Island Tortoise

Scientific classification: Chelonoidis abingdonii

Location: Ecuador

Lonesome George was seemingly the last of his kind, a member of the Pinta Island subspecies of giant tortoises in the Galapagos. When George died, the subspecies seemed to die off. But there’s an asterix to this story. Galapagos tortoises were frequently kept on ships for food (imagine livestock that doesn’t need daily feeding), but sometimes dumped off when no longer needed. Isabella Island was a popular dumping ground for tortoises across the various subspecies.



An expedition to the island in 2007 found something intriguing. Eight young tortoises seemed to be first generation hybrids of Pinta Island tortoises and another subspecies. With 2000 tortoises living on the island, that means a Pinta Island tortoise is likely hiding somewhere on the island. So far, a total of 17 hybrids have been found, and future expeditions could yield more, and maybe even find the parent of those hybrid reptiles.
