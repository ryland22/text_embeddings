A fresh season is breathing new life into the Hamptons housing market, and bucolic Bridgehampton is seeing the sharpest growth, with a 64-percent rise in home sales in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period last year. Among those big-ticket deals: a four-acre property that fetched $22.7 million and an 11-bedroom estate in nearby Water Mill that changed hands for $26.1 million.

But don’t panic over those eye-popping prices, says Dianne McMillan Brannen, a Hamptons broker with Douglas Elliman. “Buyers get much larger homes with much smaller price tags in Bridgehampton,” she says. “For a few million dollars, you’ll get a property twice the size as in other areas of the East End.” Elliman is currently listing an eight-bedroom home with eight baths at 114 Lockwood Ave. for $5.6 million. The new-construction property measures 7,400 square feet, with a wine cellar and a swimming pool.

Meanwhile, Corcoran is marketing Barn & Vine, a collection of 37 houses off Scuttle Hole Road, next to Channing Daughters Winery in Bridgehampton. Each home has five to eight bedrooms and a private pool. Prices start at $2.9 million and rise to $3.9 million, and the offerings range in size from 3,800 to 4,269 square feet. “For that size of a home, you’d pay double that amount in other areas of the Hamptons,” says Corcoran broker Susan Breitenbach, who’s handling sales at the development.
