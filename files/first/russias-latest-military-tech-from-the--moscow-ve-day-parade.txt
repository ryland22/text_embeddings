The May 9 Victory Parade, held in Moscow every year on the anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, is one of the largest spectacles held by any government. The parade commemorates the victory of the Soviet Union over Nazi Germany after a brutal four-year war, and the Russian armed forces are the center of the parade.

The Russian military tends to march its latest and greatest military equipment during the parade, not necessarily as a way of showing off, but to assure the public that the country is well defended and that such a cataclysmic war wonâ€™t happen again. This year was no different, with new missiles, manned vehicles, and drones marching through Moscow past parade stands and throngs of Muscovites.
