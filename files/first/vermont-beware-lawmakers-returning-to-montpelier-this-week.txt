While the Legislature wasted most of the 2018 legislative session debating gun control bills which do nothing except punish law-abiding gun owners, and passing other unnecessary bills, they left their most important task, passing a state budget, unfinished. As a result, lawmakers are coming back to Montpelier again this week at outrageous taxpayer expense in a special session. They will reconvene this Wednesday, May 30.

To make matters worse, greedy gun ban supporters have seized on the opportunity to introduce even more gun bills. Unbelievably, after passing some of the state’s harshest gun laws in the history of the state, the House Judiciary Committee will debate more newly minted gun bills. Those bills are sponsored by House Judiciary Chair Maxine Grad (D). One of those measures, H.11 by Rep. Maxine Grad, is a domestic violence bill which erodes due process protections even further than H.422 which passed during this year’s legislative session. This is especially troubling because the Committee and House can amend these bills, making them even worse, as they did with similar legislation during the 2018 Regular Session.

Please contact your state Representative and respectfully insist that they take care of their actual state business and stop grandstanding with a narrow, extreme political agenda. They have punished law-abiding gun owners enough this session.

Please contact your state Representatives and call and leave a message with the Sergeant at Arms at 802-828-2228. Please call Wednesday morning as we have confirmed that they will resume taking messages when the Legislature is in session on Wednesday.
