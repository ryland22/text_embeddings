The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons’ (OPCW's) confirmation that chorine was likely used in an attack in Syria on 4 February is “a source of deep confusion”, according to a statement released by the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD).

The 15 May report by the OPCW’s Fact Finding Mission (FFM) said environmental samples provided by the Syrian Civil Defence (White Helmets) organisation indicated that chlorine was used as a weapon against the rebel-held town of Saraqib. The FFM is not mandated to identify the perpetrators of attacks, but interviewed witnesses who said the devices that contained the agent were dropped from a helicopter, indicating the Syrian Air Force was responsible.
