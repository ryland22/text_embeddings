Since 1999, the Healdsburg Jazz Festival (HJF) held in Sonoma County, CA, has had a reputation for excellence. Over the years, it has hosted internationally acclaimed jazz musicians and educated the public in this truly unique American art form. This year, from June 1–10, the festival will mark 20 consecutive years of bringing the living, breathing, ever-changing jazz music to Healdsburg.

With such an exciting anniversary to celebrate, the Healdsburg Jazz Festival is planning to offer some free concerts, as well as an incredible lineup of musicians for this ten-day festival. Still recovering from the devastating wildfire that swept through the region in October of 2017, the Healdsburg Jazz Festival is hoping that by offering healing music and celebrations, it will bring in visitors who want to support the community. They’ll be joined by Healdsburg locals who have loved and looked forward to this tradition for 20 years.

“I love that the jazz festival happens in my town. We don’t have a lot of cultural diversity here,” said Rhonda Bellmer, school principal and Healdsburg resident. “When the Festival is here, the town is alive. You can feel it. I love the variety of music styles – something can be found for everyone.”

The San Francisco Chronicle has called it “…one of the best small jazz festivals in the country, if not the world.” Each year, almost 10,000 guests who are either jazz lovers, or those curious to learn more, attend the festival. Its success is all because of the passion, focus and connections of Jessica Felix, HJF’s founder and Artistic Director.

This year, the festival planners want to celebrate the friendships that have been made with many performers over the years. The opening concert, which is already sold out, features local guitarist Julian Lage and Bill Frisell, one of the leading jazz guitarists in the nation, at SHED, a local restaurant, farm and gathering place. Their performances will kick off this special anniversary celebration. They’ll be joined over the course of the festival by a multitude of jazz greats, like Festival All Stars with Bobby Watson, Azar Lawrence, David Weiss, Billy Hart, Babatunde Lea and special guest Chico Freeman; Charles Lloyd, Zakir Hussain, Gerald Clayton, and Eric Harland; Trio da Paz with guests Anat Cohen and Claudia Villela; the Marc Cary Trio and many more, who will all contribute to making this festival one that visitors will never forget.

“The Healdsburg Jazz Festival really feels like a festival,” said jazz musician Fred Hersch. “People who don’t even listen to or know much about jazz attend because they’re aware that something special is in their town. So, they listen, they are open to a wide range of programming, they have learned over the years…to check it out. That’s a really positive thing about the festival.”

Jessica Felix, HJF’s founder and Artistic Director, moved to Healdsburg in 1994 and opened a gallery called Art and All That Jazz, where she sold her own jewelry designs, and jazz CDs. She envisioned a jazz festival, imagining the music being played in beautiful wineries and other intimate locations in the area.

“My love of jazz started near the end of high school, in the 1960s. I started listening to a little Cal Tjader and Willie Bobo while still loving rock and Bob Dylan,” said Felix. “Then I heard Charles Lloyd’s Forest Flower, bought the album and fell completely in love with the music. I played it every morning, even in college. The music really opened me up to jazz. It’s hard for me to believe that now I am friends’ with Charles, who has performed at the festival many times. Around the same time, I fell in love with John Handy’s Live at Monterey and Pharoah Sanders’ Karma; especially with the tune ‘The Creator Has a Master Plan.’ I discovered that this was my music and I fell deeply in sync with it.”

On January 14, 1995, Felix and her good friend George Cables produced a concert at the Dancing Goat (which later became the Flying Goat). At $8 a ticket, the concert sold out, which indicated that there was an audience for jazz in Sonoma. For four years she continued to host small concerts around town and spoke about jazz with people in the area, who started to believe in her idea for a festival.

“I met Elizabeth Candelario, the executive director of the Healdsburg Arts Council at the time, and Dan Zastrow, who ran the Raven Theater. In 1998, they urged me to start a festival to get ahead of a rumored ‘smooth jazz’ promoter,” said Felix. “So, in 1999, Elizabeth got the first sponsors and Dan got us the venue.”

This year, many musicians and friends of HJF are returning to celebrate with Jessica Felix and others who have been instrumental in making HJF a can’t-miss event.

“I get a lot of credit, but the bulk of the credit really goes to the great volunteers and our generous patrons and sponsors. It’s a lot of work, more than anyone could imagine, but I have a passion and drive to keep it going and make the 20-year milestone,” said Felix. “I see the festival as bringing the gift of music to people here. When they experience the quality of live music, and learn about many groups they just heard for the first time, they want to keep coming back. So many friendships have resulted. That’s why this 20th anniversary is called ‘Friends Returning.’
