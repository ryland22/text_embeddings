Wacker Metroark Chemicals has opened a new hydrosilylation plant for manufacturing functional silicone fluids at its Amtala site near Kolkata in the Indian state of West Bengal.

The new €6m plant at Amtala will be capable of producing 6,000mt of functional silicone fluids per annum to meet the increasing regional demand for specialty silicones for use in the textile, personal-care, rigid and flexible polyurethane foam and agrochemical sectors.

Wacker Chemie executive board member Christian Hartel said: “With this expansion of our production, we are broadening our product portfolio and can thereby open up new markets in the growth regions of India and South East Asia.



“This investment underscores the commitment of Wacker to the Indian market and shows that our company is continuously growing its technical expertise and capacities in Asia.”

“With this expansion of our production, we are broadening our product portfolio and can open up new markets in the growth regions of India and South East Asia.”

Hydrosilylation is a chemical process wherein organofunctional groups, such as glycols, olefins or ketones, are ‘docked’ onto the periphery of silicones.

This process modifies the properties of the end product and render a silicone fluid, for instance, hydrophobic (water-repellent) or hydrophilic (water-attracting).

The products manufactured in Amtala can also be used to produce polyurethane foams, in which functional silicone fluids serve as additives for adjusting the cell structure.

Wacker Metroark Chemicals managing director Soumitra Mukherjee said: “Our new hydrosilylation plant enables us to address promising new markets where we haven’t been represented in India and South East Asia until now, for example the market for silicone functional fluids with its many sales opportunities.

“In this way, we intend to secure our position as the market and technology leader for silicones in the region and provide a basis for further growth.”
