Are you ready to get ABBA stuck in your head again? The first trailer for "Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again" is here, and the whole gang is back. The sequel to 2008's "Mamma Mia!" is set for release in 2018, 10 years after the original. "Here We Go Again" follows Sophie, who is pregnant, as she learns more about her mother's past.

Amanda Seyfried, Meryl Streep, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard and Colin Firth all reprise their roles, and Lily James, who starred in "Cinderella," joins the cast as a flashback version of Streep's character, Donna.

In the trailer, Sophie, played by Seyfried, feels empowered after her mother's friends Tanya and Rosie tell her more about what Donna was like when she was pregnant with Sophie.

Earlier this month, James confessed to Seth Meyers on "Late Night" that playing a younger version of Streep was intimidating. She said that her role as Elizabeth Layton, Winston Churchill's secretary in "Darkest Hour," was challenging, "But Meryl is Meryl."

"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again" hits theaters on July 20, 2018.
