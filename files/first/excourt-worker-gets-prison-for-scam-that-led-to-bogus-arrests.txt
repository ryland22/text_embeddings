A former courthouse staffer who pocketed $160,000 in summons payments​ ​–​ ​leading to the arrests of at least five people​ wrongly accused of not paying their fines ​– was sentenced Wednesday ​to up to six years behind bars.

“I’m deeply ashamed of what I’ve done,” mumbled Carlos Sanchez, who pleaded guilty last month to charges of second-degree larceny, criminal possession of a forged instrument, and falsifying business records. “I apologize for my actions.”

Sanchez, once a senior court office assistant, had been responsible for processing money orders and cashiers checks submitted by New Yorkers attempting to pay their fines for low-level violations, like public consumption of alcohol or public urination.

Instead, he pocketed the funds​ ​–​ ​leading to the arrests of people who thought they’d paid their dues.

Sanchez on Wednesday was sentenced to separate terms of four to six years behind bars and one to three years behind bars, in accordance with his plea deal. He will serve both sentences at the same time.

“I don’t think he went into this intending to cause the harm that he did,” defense attorney Verena Powell said as she left court. “I really do believe once he gets out he’ll do everything he can to make everyone whole.”
