The system uses a combination of lasers, reactive scoring targets, and a smartphone or tablet app that gives the user real-time feedback of shooting performance, including speed and accuracy.

There are a lot of things you can do to practice with just an unloaded firearm, or a gun loaded with snap caps, but there are also electronic devices that can take your dry-fire practice tot he next level.

If you can’t get to the range every day, a dry-fire practice regimen can help make sure you don’t lose the skills you’ve worked for between range sessions.

The SIRT 110 pistol has the size, weight and feel of a Glock 17/22 handgun with a resettable trigger, removable magazine, and two lasers to indicate trigger prep (takeup) and break (shot). You'll have to buy one of these to take advantage of the Shooter Make Ready system.

The system also helps shooters work on things like sight picture visualization and shot groupings, all stuff you normally can’t do without live ammunition.

The app is available for iOS and Android devices and supports full 360-degree training scenarios using six targets placed anywhere you want within a 50-foot radius, which is beyond the limits of most living rooms.

The system also includes four courses of fire that can be a challenge for new or seasoned shooters alike.

Additionally, the app has Range Officer commands, start time signaling, par time and round counts so you can get a more full training experience.

The entire system isn’t insanely expensive, but it is about the price of a new handgun.

Targets sell for $79 each. You’ll also have to buy a laser SIRT pistol for use with the system, which go for $239.
