CLEVELAND, Ohio - Northeast Ohio will hit the 80s one last time during this relentless heat wave Friday before a much-welcome cooldown back to the 60s and 70s greets Cleveland the rest of the weekend. Storms will start, but some sun will follow.

Pack that rain coat for Friday. As a cold front tracks into the area it will spark up scattered storms up ahead. Thankfully, none of the thunderstorms should hold enough of a punch to cause any damage with winds or hail. But as temperatures top 80 degrees again, that means we're in for another uncomfortably hot, sticky day -- at least it's the home stretch.

Relief from the heat is ahead Saturday.

The front will leave behind noticeably cooler, and drier, air. High temperatures will settle back into the low 70s with the help of a wind shift from the northeast, and lows will hit the 60s. Dew points will drop suddenly from the 60s Friday, signaling lots of moisture in the air, to the 50s; much more pleasant. Skies will start off mostly cloudy, but as the day goes on sun will build.

Sunday is looking pretty similar with temperatures ranging from the low 60s to mid 70s. A mix of sun and clouds is expected, and with a low-pressure system passing to the south, I can't rule out a stray storm.
