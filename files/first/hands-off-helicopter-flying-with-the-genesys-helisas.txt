AIN’s Randy Padfield test flies a Bell 206 equipped with the Genesys HeliSAS autopilot and stability augmentation system (SAS). The demo pilot and Randy are able to remove their hands from the controls and the helicopter automatically stabilizes. Typically, a helicopter without autopilot requires that the pilot’s hands be on the controls at all times.
