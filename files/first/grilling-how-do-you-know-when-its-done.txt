When cooking beef, poultry and pork, always have an instant-read thermometer on

hand. Here’s how to cook meats properly so that they’re not raw or overcooked and dry:

Steaks

Final internal cooking temperature for steaks:

Rare: 120-125 degrees

Medium-rare:125-135 degrees

Medium: 135-145 degrees

Well-done: 145-155 degrees

No thermometer? Use the palm method:



Chicken

Most chicken (and turkey) cuts need a medium fire. They should be cooked to an internal temperature of 160-165 degrees before you remove them from the grill. You can take them off the grill at 160 degrees. The temperature will continue to rise.

Pork

For chops and steaks, the internal temperature should reach 160 degrees.Whole cuts (roasts, shoulder, loin) of pork should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees and allowed to rest three minutes before slicing. Note: The U.S. Department of Agriculture says ground beef and pork should be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 degrees.
