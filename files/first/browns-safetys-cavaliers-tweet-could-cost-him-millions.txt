Damarious Randall might have to dig deep into his pockets should the Cavaliers best the Warriors in the NBA Finals.

Taking to Twitter on Monday night, the Browns safety, who was traded to Cleveland from Green Bay in the offseason, pledged he’d purchase jerseys if LeBron James scores another championship title for the city.

“If the Cleveland Cavaliers win the 2018 NBA Finals I’ll buy everyone who retweet’s this a jersey …,” Randall, 25, wrote to his 128,000 followers.

With 695,000 retweets and counting, Randall doubled down on his promise Tuesday night after a fan accused him of bluffing.

Randall might be one of the few betting on James to pull off a miracle when the series tips off Thursday. The Warriors opened as a -1000 favorite to win their third title in four years, per the Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas.
