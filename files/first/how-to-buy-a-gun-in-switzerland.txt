You will often her people on both sides of the gun control debate bring up Switzerland in one way or another, mentioning that they have a high per capita rate of gun ownership and very low crime rates.

But what do citizens actually go through to purchase firearms in Switzerland, and what are they prohibited from purchasing?

For gun owners in the U.S., the exact length of your gun barrel, or the overall length of a given firearm, can mean the difference between compliance with the law and a committing a major felony.

So hearing that these things, along with collapsible stocks and such, are of no concern to the Swiss is a bit shocking.

As the narrator in the video above states, to purchase a firearm, one must obtain a form that looks, from what I can tell, quite a bit like the ATF 4473 Form, at least in function.

The form states you donâ€™t have a criminal record and other basic info.

You send that in to the police and get it back in one or two weeks.
