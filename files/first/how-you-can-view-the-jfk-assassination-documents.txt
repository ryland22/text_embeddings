The National Archives is releasing a batch of JFK assassination files online. Thursday evening, President Trump ordered 2,800 records released but decided that others should be withheld for further review for national security reasons.

Last weekend, President Trump said he had decided to allow the release of the documents to the public. The secret government files have inspired conspiracy theories for decades that for example, Lee Harvey Oswald, wasn't the only person involved in the plot. The collection includes more than 3,100 documents, which could amount to tens of thousands of pages. According to the National Archives and Records Administration, approximately 88 percent of the files and documentation had been released and available to the public since the late 1990s.
