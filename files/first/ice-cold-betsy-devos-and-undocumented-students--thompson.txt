Testifying earlier this week before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, Education Secretary of Ed Betsy DeVos suggested that schools can report undocumented students to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.

There's just one problem with DeVos' idea: According to civil rights groups, it would be against the law for an educator to report a student to immigration enforcement officials.

That's because a 1982 Supreme Court ruling held that all students, no matter their immigration status, are entitled to a free public education. In fact, even asking a student about their immigration status would be illegal.

"A 2014 fact sheet put out by the Education and Justice Departments states that schools 'may not ask about your or your child's citizenship or immigration status,"' the publication Education Week reported.

Will someone please educate the education secretary?
