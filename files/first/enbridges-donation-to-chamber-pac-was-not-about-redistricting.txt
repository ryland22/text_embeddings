Nancy Kaffer's column about Enbridge's contribution to a Michigan Chamber political action committee ("Enbridge Oil's Dark Money Coincidence," May 13) seems intent on trying to connect dots where none exist. Enbridge has no position on the Michigan redistricting ballot initiative and has not contributed any dollars toward any efforts to support or oppose the Michigan redistricting initiative.

Like many Michiganders, Enbridge is passionate about protecting our natural resources; we are equally passionate about sharing accurate information related to Line 5 to ensure your readers know the facts.

Last fall when we made a contribution to the Chamber PAC II, petitions were being circulated for a ballot initiative that called for Enbridge’s Line 5 to be closed. The contribution we made was to augment the chamber’s efforts in support of Line 5 and against the potential ballot initiative to close a pipeline system that is vital to the state.

Line 5 is critical infrastructure that ensures the safe transportation of 80% of Michigan-produced crude oil. The pipeline also carries natural gas liquids to meet 55% of Michigan’s overall propane demand.

Enbridge will continue to safely provide the energy on which this region depends, day in, day out.
