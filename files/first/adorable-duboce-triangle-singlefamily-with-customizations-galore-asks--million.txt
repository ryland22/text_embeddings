There is nothing cookie-cutter about 32 Church Street, a three-bedroom, 2.5-bath home with a separate accessory unit half a block from the J and N stop on Duboce.

“The home was meticulously designed for the owner’s long-term use,” explains the listing site. “The thoughtfulness and attention to detail is evident in the custom concealed built-in trash bins; cabinets flush with the stairs containing hidden storage; wall paint matched to light switch plates; reconstructed plaster walls; and reclaimed wainscoting from a 100-year-old SF factory in some areas.”

We love that the owner updated the home with a mind toward keeping up the aesthetic of the original 1924 structure while also blending in some very 21st century touches.

One of the bathrooms, for example, plays off the black and white hex tiles seen throughout the 1920s and ’30s, but modernizes the look by utilizing an oversized tile, black cabinetry, double-sink vanity and a glass enclosed shower.

The accessory unit out back has exposed timber beams, a wood-burning fireplace and grided windows that mimic those from the main home’s facade. But it puts that focal point on a moveable wall of the glass that allows the entertaining space to be open (or not) to the secluded courtyard.

There’s a similar glass grid across the courtyard, which looks into the tandem two-car garage—though the owner seems to have it currently set up as a home gym.

This courtyard itself is a definite draw, and carries through the modern/vintage mix up in the interior spaces. It has a built-in kitchen with a grill, sink and even beer taps, not to mention the slab concrete patio floor and horizontal plank fence for a more contemporary look. But then the arts-and-crafts-inspired light fixtures and bead board ceiling overhanging the outdoor seating area certainly speak to an earlier time.

What is unassailably updated is the price: $2,400,000 for a home whose entire lot size is less than 2,000 square feet.
