Raytheon has been awarded a contract from the Defense Department for ballistic radar tracking.

The deal, from U.S. Army Contracting Command, was announced Thursday in a Pentagon press release and is valued at more than $395.8 million, enabling Raytheon to provide "phased array tracking on radar to intercept option fire unit."

Phased array radar systems are used to scan, identify and track both enemy planes and incoming ballistic missiles from the ground level, extending to the air.

Work on the contract will occur in multiple locations in Massachusetts, along with Texas, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania.

The contract is expected to be complete in April 2020.

More than $289.6 million will be obligated to Raytheon at time of award from fiscal 2018 foreign military sales fund, the Pentagon said.
