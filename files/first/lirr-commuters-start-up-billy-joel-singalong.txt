Sing us a song, Long Island Rail Road riders!

In a very un-New York-like show of unity on a commuter train, an entire LIRR car busted out singing “Piano Man,” video posted to Twitter shows.

The 10-second clip shows nearly everyone on the car singing in unison while smiling and swaying.

The song is written by Long Island native son Billy Joel, who is also known for “New York State of Mind.”

Pro tennis player Jules Elbaba said she was riding on the Huntington-bound train at about “9 o’clock on a Saturday” when she struck up a conversation with a guy in a Billy Joel tribute band. She asked him to sing a few bars and then joined in. Seconds later, the whole car was belting it out.

“Before I knew it, the whole car was singing,” said the 23-year-old from Oyster Bay.

Elbaba posted the video on Twitter with an uplifting caption, wishing that LIRR riders could always get along so well.

“When you get the entire @LIRR to sing Piano Man by @billyjoel,” she wrote. “This is what society should be like… peaceful, united and happy.”
