Consumer Reports on Wednesday did an about-face on its harsh review of the Tesla Model 3, saying it now recommends the mass-market sedan after a software update shortened its braking distance by nearly 20 feet.

The magazine last week had refused to recommend the hotly anticipated electric car, citing a 152-foot braking distance from 60 mph. That was “far worse than any contemporary car we’ve tested” — about 7 feet more than a full-size Ford F-150 pickup, the magazine said.

In response, Tesla CEO Elon Musk last week said he would address the problem with a software update in a few days and improve the Model 3 until it “has better braking than any remotely comparable car.”

After downloading Tesla’s update, Consumer Reports said that its test sedan stopped in 133 feet, a 19-foot improvement.

News of the Model 3 getting Consumer Reports’ recommendation Wednesday recently sent Tesla shares up 3.3 percent to $293.15.

In a post on its website, Consumer Reports’ director of auto testing, Jake Fisher, said that in his 19 years at the company, he has never “seen a car that could improve its track performance with an over-the-air update.”

The Model 3, which starts at $35,000, is seen as crucial to Tesla’s profitability at a time when it is battling reports of crashes involving its Autopilot software, questions over funding and production shortfalls. Musk has said the fully loaded Model 3, excluding its controversial Autopilot feature, will retail at $78,000.

Musk tweeted his appreciation to Consumer Reports following the updated review.

“Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from @ConsumerReports,” he wrote.
