Tim Just took his Wolf Samson biplane to the skies for the first time on Friday while Sammy Mason flew his S1-S as the chase plane.

A beautiful Wolf Samson biplane, a larger version of the Pitts and the only one flying today, returned to the skies over the weekend. The airplane is owned by Tim Just of Apple Valley, California, who recently imported the airplane from Germany where it has lived since it was built by renowned airplane-builder Steve Wolf in 2005. “I’m the caretaker of a piece of art that Steve Wolf built,” Just said.

While a stunning design, the airplane has had an unfortunate history. Samson was designed by Curtis Pitts in the late 1940s. The airplane, which is powered by a 450-horsepower radial engine, was built as a one-off for airshow performer Jess Bristow. Bristow sold it and the airplane was later totaled when it collided with an Ercoupe during a landing in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

The first Samson replica was built by Steve Wolf in 1985. The airplane became famous as Bobby Younkin flew it in various airshows as a solo performer and as part of a thrilling airshow act called Masters of Disaster. Tragically, that airplane also succumbed to a mid-air during an airshow in 2005 in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, in Canada, as Younkin and his airshow partner Jimmy Franklin performed together. Both Younkin and Franklin died in the accident.
