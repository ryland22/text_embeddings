The world comes to Pebble Beach at least a couple of weekends a year. But only once will visitors find themselves in the company of a hundred of the world’s greatest chefs paired with over 250 premier wineries. Now in its second decade, Pebble Beach Food & Wine (PBFW) stands among the world’s best food and wine festivals. While many visitors adopt an à la carte approach to the weekend, those in the know book one of three packages to ensure they won’t miss a drop. Each package allows the ticket holder to customize the weekend by purchasing tickets to select events according to individual taste.

Here’s a close look at these three exceptional packages that will keep your FOMO in check and guarantee a great time.

The Magnum Package provides entry to Thursday night’s marquee event, the VIP Opening Night Reception. Hosted by The Inn at Spanish Bay, this party never fails to entertain, as 23 of the top PBFW chefs pair their specialties with more than 200 international and domestic wines. Guests with a Magnum Package (or any other) gain early access at 6pm for the Vintage Hour to taste reserve bottles from all 125 of the evening’s wineries, as well as entrance to one of the hardest tickets in town, the Chef & Winemakers After-Hours Party! Historically, the OpeningNight Reception has been very challenging to attend without a package purchase.

Magnum guests visit the Lexus Grand Tasting for lunch on Saturday and, after attending another cooking demonstration or wine seminar Sunday morning, round out the epicurean extravaganza with Sunday lunch at the Lexus Grand Tasting.

Think of the Jeroboam Package as the Magnum Package on steroids, especially designed for those foodies and wine lovers who are all in, all the time. No missed opportunities here, the Jeroboam guest sets forth for the weekend at the Opening Night Reception and Chef & Winemaker After-Hours Party, then rolls into Friday with morning cooking demonstrations or wine seminars including, if desired, a reserve wine seminar.

Jeroboam guests choose from eight luncheon options including the Lexus Chef’s Table Lunch featuring Angie Mar of Beatrice Inn in New York, and Naomi Pomeroy of Beast in Portland. Only Jeroboam and Imperial Package guests can claim a place at the Lexus Chef’s Table Lunch.

Cooking demonstrations or wine seminars are scheduled for Friday and Saturday afternoon. The seminars may feature tales of the winery life over Rombauer Chardonnay; the demonstrations may include “Cooking with Alex Guarnaschelli,” where the chef shares insights from her bestselling book, The Home Cook: Recipes to Know by Heart.

Pebble Beach Food & Wine has always presented culinary opulence with a distinctively California accent. Far from an exclusively haute cuisine assembly, demonstrations, seminars, and events are as likely to showcase mac n’ cheese as caviar—this year’s festival features both. Friday’s Marquee Event is no exception. “Coastal Grillin’” is a celebration that draws talent and provender from Miami, Monterey, Texas (of course), and Hawai’i. Jeroboam guests can get their grill on or, for additional surcharges, choose from Champagne dinners or the “NoMad Supper Club featuring Allen Stone.”

There are more bubbles for Jeroboam package guests on Saturday evening, should they choose “Barolo, Brunello & Bubbles–Dinner with the Kings” at the Lodge at Pebble Beach. Saturday’s Marquee Event, “Taco Takedown Featuring Chef Lorena Garcia” adds zest to the party. As always, package guests can choose from other menus and wine lists as well. Sunday winds up with more cooking or wine seminar choices, followed by the Lexus Grand Tasting.





The Imperial Package embellishes the PBFW with a gilded experience, all weekend long. Guests can start their day early with a reduced entrance fee to the Celebrity Chef & Winemaker Golf Tournament on the iconic Pebble Beach Golf Links. Golfers relax beside the Pacific before retelling tales from the world famous links at the Opening Night Reception. Putting distances lengthen at the Saturday After-Hours Party.

Friday begins with either a Jeremiah Tower-led cooking demonstration or one of several wine seminars, including “Thierry Allemand: The Symphony of the Syrah–Cornas for Kings,” featuring exceptional vintages from the once forgotten Northern Rhône region. Lunch choices travel from the Hawaiian Islands to the Mediterranean to Sacramento and beyond.

Post afternoon wine seminars or cooking demonstrations, Imperial guests enjoy their choice of dinners choosing from “Single Thread: Grower Champagne Dinner,” featuring more than 20 grower champagnes from the likes of Pierre Peters, Chartogne Taillet, Vilmart, and Legras & Haas. The legendary NYC outpost Nomad recently opened a second location in Los Angeles, join the Nomad team for an evening of live music and rare wines on a beach front private property in Pebble Beach for “NoMad Supper Club featuring Allen Stone”. Exclusive admission to the After-Hours Party remains.

Imperial Package guests enjoy the choice of all cooking demonstrations and wine seminars all weekend long but the most exclusive part of the package are the wine tastings. Guests will have access to historic retrospectives of Chateau Haut Brion, Krug Clos du Mesnil, Thierry Allemand, Poggio di Soto, and a tasting of one of the most sought after Domaines in the world, Coche Dury. Jeremiah Tower returns to prepare dinner in the evening, among other menus including “NoMad Supper Club featuring Citizen Cope.” Naturally, the After-Hours Party follows for Imperial guests.

Sunday draws to a close with a cooking demonstration from “America’s Test Kitchen with Bridget & Julia” or wine seminars, followed by the Lexus Grand Tasting on Sunday. The Imperial Package guest savors every element of the Pebble Beach Food & Wine festival like they were plump grapes on the vine.

The best subscriptions, be they to the theater or a golf tournament, take the guesswork out of our cultural decision-making. As others hustle to get them, we relax knowing those Hamilton or Pebble Beach Pro-Am tickets are already well in hand. The same can be said at the Pebble Beach Food & Wine festival. With three packages, PBFW invites us inside the ropes for the best performances, tastings, and events. Unlike theater or golf, however, the Imperial, Jeroboam, and Magnum Packages take the guesswork out of dining and drinks decisions as well, given these limited guests will enjoy the craft from the finest chefs and winemakers in the world.
