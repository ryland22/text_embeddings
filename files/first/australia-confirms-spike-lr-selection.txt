Australia has confirmed its selection of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems’ Spike LR2 anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) to meet a requirement under Land 400 Phase 2.

An official from the Australian Department of Defence’s (DoD’s) Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group (CASG) told a Senate hearing on 30 May that the Spike was selected ahead of its rival in the programme, MBDA’s Missile Moyenne Portée (MMP).

Under the programme, the Spike LR2 will be integrated onto the Rheinmetall Boxer combat reconnaissance vehicle (CRV), which was selected as prime contractor on Land 400 Phase 2 in mid-March.
