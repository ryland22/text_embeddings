The princess has been cursed by a witch, and your job is to cut her apart and save her.

Princess Plastic Surgery is one of dozens of plastic surgery games on Apple and Android app stores: other games will let you perfect nose jobs, try performing surgery on the body, or give face lifts. The games have brightly colored graphics, questionable taglines, and have been stirring up serious controversy. A Change.org petition to ban plastic surgery games for kids has amassed over 100,000 signatures.

In the past, more egregious apps have been removed: a 2013 app called Plastic Surgery & Plastic Doctor & Plastic Hospital Office got removed from the iTunes store, perhaps because of its startling game description: "This unfortunate girl has so much extra weight that no diet can help her...We’ll need to make small cuts on problem areas and suck out the extra fat. Will you operate her, doctor??”

But surgery-themed games still proliferate on app stores, and invite serious criticisms, alongside self-monitoring health apps like fitness or diet trackers. “The ‘gaming’ aspect of some of the apps I found made me feel uneasy,” said Kate Harvey, a senior researcher on a Nuffield Council on Bioethics report. “The invasiveness of cosmetic procedures, and the potential vulnerabilities of those who might access those procedures, means that ‘playing’ with beauty ideals is a road which should be travelled down very cautiously.”

Meanwhile, plastic surgeons are also creating apps to help real patients visualize and plan for surgeries. Elective surgery is a business, after all, and apps can allow potential patients to explore opportunities without committing to the surgery just yet.
