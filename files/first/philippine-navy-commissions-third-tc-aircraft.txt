The Philippine Navy has enhanced its aerial maritime surveillance capabilities with a third TC-90

Service is on track to operate a fleet of five aircraft in the coming months

The Philippine Navy’s Naval Air Group (NAG) has commissioned a third Beechcraft TC-90 King Air aircraft that was formerly in service with the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF).

The aircraft, which bears the serial number 394, was commissioned on 29 May in a ceremony officiated by the Philippine Navy’s flag officer in command, Vice Admiral Robert A Empedrad, at the NAG’s headquarters at Sangley Point, Cavite City.

The airframe is part of an assistance package of five TC-90s donated by the Japanese government to improve the Philippine Navy’s aerial maritime surveillance capabilities.
