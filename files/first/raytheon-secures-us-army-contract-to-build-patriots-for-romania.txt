Raytheon has secured a US Army contract award worth nearly USD400 million to build Romania’s new Patriot missile defence system. Romania will join five other European NATO countries (Greece, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, and Spain) that are also Patriot users. NATO partner country Sweden has also expressed interest in the system.

Announced late on 24 May, the USD395.85 million contract and much of its production work will be carried out at Raytheon sites across the United States for completion by April 2020, although the company said it is reviewing how to spread the work to include Romanian suppliers.

“We are working to incorporate Romanian industry into our global supply chain, with the goal of soon issuing our first purchase order to a Romanian company,” Tom Laliberty, vice-president of integrated air and missile defence at Raytheon’s Integrated Defense Systems business, said in a 25 May statement.
