Pat Davis is dropping out. The New Mexico Democrat who made headlines with his “f**k the NRA” ad has decided to back his challenger instead. He’s doing it to help shore up party unity in the race that’s considered a toss up. Current representative for New Mexico’s first district is Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham, who is running for governor; incumbent Republican Gov. Susana Martinez is term-limited (via KOB4):

"...this year, progressives have a lot of good choices, and it is clear to me that by remaining divided, none of us will win," said Davis. Davis was set to face Haaland and Democrat Damon Martinez in the June primary but says instead, he will continue to work as a city councilor. "That’s why I’m setting my personal ambitions aside now and asking undecided progressives to unite around the progressive candidate who has the best chance of winning, and who I know I can work with at the City Council and as an organizer to keep pushing back against Trump," said Davis. The primary is set for one week from today, June 5.





Davis seemed to have ingratiated himself with the anti-gun Left, positioning himself as a strong ally for the cause. As with many progressives, he was invited on Tucker Carlson’s show earlier this month and was pretty much taken to the woodshed. He also claimed that an AR-15 rifle could fire 150 rounds in 15 seconds. That’s not true, folks. Not even close. Micah also noted that Davis had a drunk driving arrest in 2013, which would have certainly been used in a campaign against him. Whatever the case, he’s done. As Micah wrote, Davis might not know much about firearms, but he does know what it feels like to drive while intoxicated.
