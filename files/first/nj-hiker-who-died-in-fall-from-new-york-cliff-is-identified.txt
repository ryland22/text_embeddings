The hiker who died in a fall from a New York cliff overlooking the Delaware River Sunday night has been identified as 24-year-old Bartlomiej Rzemieniecki, of Harrison, authorities in New York said Wednesday.

New York State Police said that Rzemieniecki and two friends were hiking in the area of Hancock, New York, and that Rzemieniecki was taking pictures when he fell. Authorities in Sullivan County received a 911 call at 6:31 p.m. Sunday that the 24-year-old had fallen from Jensen's Ledge.

A Sullivan County deputy located Rzemieniecki and confirmed he had died in the fall, authorities said.

New York State Police, New York State Forest Rangers, Hancock Fire Department, Long Eddy Fire Department and the Beach Lake (Pennsylvania) Fire Department responded, but given the limited light and difficult terrain, officials decided to recover the body Monday morning. New York State Police said that forest rangers stayed with the body through the night.

Rzemieniecki's body was extricated at 2:45 p.m. Monday by the state forest rangers and the Hancock Fire Department, New York State Police said.

According to online profiles, Rzemieniecki last worked for Alpine Motorsports in Irvington, where he was an assistant manager. Rzemieniecki attended Manhattan Borough Community College and Baruch College's Zicklin School of Business, his online profile said.
