Be the photo-inspo of all your friends and find joy at Happy Place, a traveling pop-up installation of 13 rooms, ranging a 20-foot-tall double rainbow to a confetti dome to 7-foot stilettos made of candies.

“It's a really immersive experience, from the soundtrack to the smells to the touches of Happy Place,” said founder Jared Paul. “We take what we're doing very seriously, and what we're doing is over the course of about an hour trying to deliver nothing but joy and spontaneous happiness to people.”

The installation plans to run from June 28 to Aug. 6 at 1004 N. Elston Ave. Tickets start at $30 for general admission and go on sale June 4, with a pre-sale beginning June 1.

Ticketed art pop-ups have been wildly successful on the East and West coasts, perhaps exemplified by the Museum of Ice Cream and the Color Factory. Their bright colors and vibrant designs are tailor-made for Instagram; a Wired article about the trend called them “selfie factories.”

Happy Place opened in Los Angeles last year, after Paul said he wanted to bring positivity into the world for his three children. The California location took inspiration from local artists, and he said the Chicago Happy Place is influenced by the city’s architecture and food culture.

“It will have a lot of local flair, and our exterior is unique to Chicago,” he said. “Every physical building we go into gives us a new canvas to paint on, and we're kind of known for turning buildings yellow. So people can expect surprises.”
