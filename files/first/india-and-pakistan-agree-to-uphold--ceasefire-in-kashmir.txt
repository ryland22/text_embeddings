India and Pakistan have agreed to uphold their 2003 ceasefire agreement in a bid to end their almost daily exchange of artillery, mortar, missile, and small arms fire across their disputed border in the northern region of Jammu and Kashmir.

The Indian Army’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), Lieutenant General Anil Chauhan, and his Pakistani counterpart, Major General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, agreed in a 29 May conversation via a ‘dedicated’ hotline to restore calm along the 776 km Line of Control (LoC) that divides Kashmir between the nuclear-armed neighbours.

Both DGMOs agreed to “fully implement the ceasefire understanding of 2003 in letter and spirit forthwith” to ensure that it will not be violated by either party, said the two sides in similar statements carried by the Indian government’s Press Information Bureau (PIB) and the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) office, the media wing of the Pakistani military.
