The new year may be the perfect time for you to get hold of a new car – a select number manufacturers have extended their scrappage schemes deep into 2018, meaning that there's still time plenty of time to trade in an old vehicle for something new with a discount.

The current crop of scrappage schemes appeared on the UK new car market around towards the end of 2017, with manufacturer after manufacturer announcing their own programme. Today, only a handful of big marques remain commited to offering you a discount in return for taking your older car off the road – including Kia, Ford and Mazda. While most of the schemes will see traded-in cars scrapped, some will see newer vehicles brought in by customers sold on again.

• Best new cars deals

The aim of these schemes is to remove the older, more polluting vehicles from the road, though many offers are flexible, and are open to owners of relatively new model – cars registered as late as 2011 qualify for many of the schemes listed here.

It would be naïve, however, not to consider that the brains behind each scrappage offer hope the incentives will lead to an increase in sales figures too. The UK car market is suffering for a number of reasons, and one likely contributor is the uncertainty over diesels and the overall future of internal combustion cars. Something not helped by the number of big cities annoucing bans on petrol and diesel cars set to come into effect over the coming years.

Market leaders Ford reckon taking all 19 million (estimated) pre-Euro 5 cars off the road in the UK, would reduce CO2 emission by as much as 15 million tonnes per year while also reducing NOx and particulate emissions. Andy Barratt, chairman and MD of Ford of Britain, said: “Removing the most polluting vehicles will have the most immediate positive effect on air quality, and this Ford scrappage scheme aims to do just that.” Its scheme is amongst those which promises to crush each vehicle that is traded in.

To make sure you can understand whether you really are having a positive impact on the environment, rather than just getting a bit of a deal on a new car, we’ve created this summary. Depending on what you are planning to trade in for, the savings available range from £2,000 to £8,000, so read on below to find out whether you can do the environment a favour and get yourself some new wheels.
