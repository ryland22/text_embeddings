Key Points

The South African government is now moving towards a programme of major land redistribution under existing regulations, which will need time to show its effectiveness

The ANC is struggling to resolve leadership battles in key provinces, as allies of former president Jacob Zuma resist removal.

Delaying the general election raises the risk that Zuma allies will organise more concerted resistance, endangering the chances of the ANC winning an outright majority and being able to implement its policy programme.

Event

Cyril Ramaphosa will mark his first 100 days in office as South African president tomorrow (25 May) with the satisfaction of having made an impressive start, but also with the probable realisation that his scope to capitalise on his initial popularity by calling early elections is now declining.

Initial euphoria was generated among many supporters of the African National Congress (ANC), the domestic business community, and foreign investors simply by the removal of Jacob Zuma as president. This was then reinforced by decisive Ramaphosa actions to improve governance and tackle corruption and mismanagement of failing state-owned enterprises. More recently, however, Ramaphosa has been sidetracked by two ongoing issues that make early polls unlikely and frustrate policy direction – the debate over land expropriation without compensation, and institutional resistance from Zuma supporters in the ANC which is frustrating efforts to install new provincial leaderships.

Over the weekend of 18–19 May, the ANC held a land summit in Boksberg, at which the ruling party’s National Executive Committee heard inputs from party members and experts studying the issue of land expropriation in an effort to formulate a policy on land reform. The ANC’s elective conference in Johannesburg had agreed on 20 December 2017 to seek constitutional change to allow expropriation without compensation.
