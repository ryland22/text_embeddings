Two days after stunning EBACE by unveiling its re-powered Global 5500 and 6500, Bombardier has announced the show’s biggest deal – with a Hong Kong aircraft management firm for up to 18 Global jets.

The letter of intent for Global 6500s and 7500s was inked yesterday evening, and celebrated on the static display by David Coleal, president Bombardier Business Aircraft, and Zhang Yijia, president of HK Bellawings. If all options are exercised, the transaction would be worth $1.14 billion at list prices.

HK Bellawings, founded in 2014, operates a fleet of Bombardier Global and Challenger, Gulfstream, Dassault Falcon, Boeing and Embraer aircraft. the company says the ultra-long-range types “align with our rapid development to be a one-stop business aviation solution, empowering us to reach higher and further in the long run”.

As well as launching new versions of its Global 5000 and 6000 as the 5500 and 6500, with new Rolls-Royce Pearl engines, the Canadian airframer is also rebranding its flagship jet as the Global 7500, reflecting its industry-topping 7,700nm (14,300km) range.
