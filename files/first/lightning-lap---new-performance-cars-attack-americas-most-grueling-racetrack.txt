To lap VIR quickly, a car must be able to expertly navigate every kind of corner imaginable. Fast sweepers and tight hairpins, inclines and declines, and one terrifying off-camber and downhill left (Turn 10). This is our benchmark test of what a car can really accomplish, because as much as zero-to-60-mph times, braking distances, and maximum lateral acceleration can tell you about a car, a great racetrack shows you how all those things come together. You will not find a more challenging track of this length in the U.S., which is why we selected VIR in the first place. It’s hard on brakes and tires and is exhausting for drivers. VIR is such a good test of a vehicle’s ability that General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler’s SRT team rent it to develop their newest and most incendiary machinery.
