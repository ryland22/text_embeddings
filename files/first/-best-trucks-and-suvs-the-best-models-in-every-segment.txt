To successfully ascend to the winner’s circle, vehicles need to impress in three ways. The first is by offering a strong value proposition—not to be confused with a low price, as we’re strong believers that vehicular excellence is worth paying for. It must also inspire in how well it fulfills its mission and that of the segment in which it competes. And, finally, it has to be engaging to drive. Not because the pickup truck or minivan that exhibits the least amount of body roll should win—after all, that type of dynamic behavior would likely be at odds with its job—but there’s no reason those with large families, large hobbies, or other reasons for driving a large vehicle should have an experience that’s less than confidence inspiring.
