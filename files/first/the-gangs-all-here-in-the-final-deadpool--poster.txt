The 2016 film Deadpool brought some much-needed irreverence to superhero films. By the looks of things, its upcoming sequel, Deadpool 2, isn't going clean up its act—and we're okay with that, since it is one of our most anticipated movies of the year.

This is an exclusive look at the final poster of Deadpool 2, and the gang has gotten much, much bigger. With Josh Brolin's Cable looming large in the background, a few other new faces stand out as well. There's Shatterstar (Lewis Tan), originally created by Rob Liefeld in 1991, who has supernatural strength, intelligence, and can teleport—so expect some pretty sudden location hopping. Also created by Liefeld is Domino, played by Zazie Beetz, who's most famous for being a member of X-Force, a superhero team that Domino says in the trailer sounds "a little derivative."

Other characters include Bedlam (Terry Crews), Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), Russell (Julian Dennison), Mick (Jack Kesey), Blind Al (Leslie Uggams), Weasel (T.J. Miller), and my personal favorite, Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). This awesomely named character was created by Grant Morrison and Frank Quietly in 2001 and has telepathy after receiving training from Emma Frost (played by January Jones in X-Men: First Class).

There also appears to be some kind of invisible mutant, which you can see on the left. Eagle-eyed fans have already spotted this character in the trailers, and think it could be the Vanisher. We'll just have to wait and see.

Basically this poster has everything but the kitchen sink, except of course, there is also an flaming kitchen sink in the right corner so...it guess it has that, too.

Deadpool 2 is in theaters May 18, 2018.
