There's nothing like a bit of nice weather to get you warmed up for the truly hot times: the summer concert season.

With May comes the arrival of one of metro Detroit's perennial favorite pastimes, as music fans scoop up their tickets and spend four months flocking to the region's amphitheaters, festivals and arenas.

Michigan certainly isn't alone in its habits, and the summer season is make-or-break time for the concert industry: Last year, the period between Memorial Day and Labor Day generated $1.8 billion in North American touring revenue, according to Billboard Boxscore — meaning those 14 weeks were responsible for 42% of the industry's entire 2017 earnings.

In these parts, DTE Energy Music Theatre in Clarkston will once again lead the way: There are already 49 shows in the books for this summer, up significantly from last year, when DTE still moved 428,000 patrons through its turnstiles to rank No. 4 among U.S. amphitheaters, according to Pollstar data.

Some of the year's high-profile DTE dates include Paul Simon (June 10), Thirty Seconds to Mars (June 12), Kendrick Lamar (June 13), Willie Nelson's Outlaw Festival (June 24), Niall Horan with Maren Morris (Aug. 28) and Ozzy Osbourne (Sept. 19). While Eddie Money isn't the official season opener this year — that honor belongs to Christian pop musician Chris Tomlin — he's still got his customary spot up front, playing DTE on May 25.

Here's a survey of metro Detroit's summer concert scene: (Note: Most tickets are available at venue box offices, or at www.ticketmaster.com, www.livenation.com, www.aeglive.com or www.ticketweb.com. Service fees and other charges may apply.)

• After a quiet year for stadium shows in Detroit, the big sports facilities will be hopping in 2018.

Beyoncé and Jay-Z will bring blue-chip star power to Ford Field on Aug. 13, part of a busy stretch at the Lions' home that will include Kenny Chesney's latest country party (Aug. 4), Taylor Swift (Aug. 28) — making her first Detroit appearance in three years — and Ed Sheeran (Sept. 8), who will work to command the football stadium with his one-man show.

Comerica Park will host back-to-back shows while the Tigers are out of town in mid-July: a classic-rock pairing of Journey and Def Leppard on July 13, followed by Zac Brown Band's country-rock marathon July 14.

• It's a year for goodbyes. A slew of artists have declared upcoming farewell tours, and while seasoned music fans know those sorts of promises can be fluid over time, here are some of the acts who could be making final Detroit appearances: Slayer (May 27, Michigan Lottery Amphitheatre at Freedom Hill), Paul Simon (June 10, DTE), Lynyrd Skynyrd (Aug. 10, DTE) and Ozzy Osbourne (Sept. 19, DTE).

The summer will also bring a final bow for the Vans Warped Tour, which formed in 1995 in the heat of skate- and pop-punk culture and is checking out with a lineup that includes Sum 41, Taking Back Sunday, the Used and Reel Big Fish. (July 20, Meadow Brook Amphitheater)

And keep an eye out for a coming hometown show from R&B songstress Anita Baker, who has announced her intention to retire.

• Among all the farewells, there's plenty of stuff on the other side of the spectrum: young and rising artists headed to town for their biggest headlining shows here yet. They include rappers Post Malone (May 29, Freedom Hill), Logic (June 28, DTE) and G-Eazy (Aug. 16, DTE), along with pop-R&B breakout Khalid (June 1, Meadow Brook). Sam Smith, the British crooner who played Masonic Temple in 2015, is making the jump to Little Caesars Arena on June 22.

While One Direction certainly did its share of time on Detroit's biggest stages, a pair of alumni are set to play their biggest solo shows here: Harry Styles will hit LCA on June 26, while Niall Horan will have Maren Morris in tow for a DTE show on Aug. 28.

• Eminem is more active this year than usual, with 16 performances on his schedule, including festival performances and several European standalone dates. What you won't find on that list is Detroit, which means it's now four years and counting since the superstar rapper last played his hometown. That wasn't supposed to be the case: a planned stadium show in downtown Detroit fell through as his summer itinerary was getting hammered out.

• The summer will bring visits from a few acts we haven't seen around these parts in quite awhile, including Jeff Lynne's ELO (Aug. 16, LCA), playing Detroit for the first time since 1981; Jack Johnson (June 15, DTE), returning after an eight-year absence; and Radiohead (July 22), who finally broke a long Detroit hiatus in 2012 only to put us off again for six more years.

The somewhat-reunited Smashing Pumpkins — Billy Corgan, James Iha and Jimmy Chamberlin, minus D'arcy Wretzky — will hit LCA on Aug. 5.

• This is the first summer for 313 Presents, the joint entertainment venture formed by owners of the Red Wings and Pistons when Little Caesars Arena opened in the fall. The most notable impact on the consumer side: Fans can buy tickets (minus service fees) at any 313 Presents box office for shows in any of its other venues, which include LCA, DTE, Comerica Park, Fox Theatre, Freedom Hill and Meadow Brook.

• Chene Park will bring a busy schedule of R&B, smooth jazz and pop to Detroit's riverfront. Biggies include Patti LaBelle with Babyface (July 14), Erykah Badu with Nas (June 23) and Earth, Wind & Fire (Aug. 18). Things will go retro-'80s on July 28, when acts such as A Flock of Seagulls, Wang Chung and Naked Eyes are joined by Detroit's Romantics.

• As always, the local festival season gets rolling with Movement (May 26-28, Hart Plaza), which this year is featuring Wu-Tang Clan among the electronic-music offerings. It's the iconic hip-hop collective's first group performance here in many years.

Concert of Colors will roll out July 11-16 in Midtown Detroit, and now has a sister festival 80 miles west, as the Jackson Unity Festival debuts simultaneously to share many of CoC's world-music performers.

Faster Horses (July 20-22, Michigan International Speedway) will reunite much of the Live Nation staff that was present during the October massacre at Las Vegas' Route 91 Harvest country fest. Blake Shelton, Florida Georgia Line and the reunited Brooks & Dunn.

Labor Day weekend will bring two long-running traditions Aug. 31-Sept. 3, as the Detroit Jazz Festival lands downtown with artist-in-residence Chick Corea and Arts, Beats & Eats takes over Royal Oak with a lineup to be announced in coming weeks.

• Hometown acts are in the mix as ever, including a three-night stand by young rock band Greta Van Fleet (May 22-25, Fillmore Detroit), a pair of Chene Park shows from R&B crooner Kem (Aug. 3-4) and the obligatory visit from Michigan expat Ted Nugent (July 20, DTE).

Stone Temple Pilots — featuring Marine City-bred Jeff Gutt in his new front man role — will hit Freedom Hill on July 24.
