The global design and architecture consultants, CallisonRTKL, will move to the entire 16th floor of The Woolworth Building.

The company has leased 28,096 square feet for 10 years at the 60-story landmark property, which has an official address of 233 Broadway, where it will relocate from two floors at 148 Lafayette St.

CallisonRTKL was represented by Mitchell Konsker and David Dusek of JLL. The Cammebyâ€™s International/Witkoff group ownership was represented by Brian Siegel, David Ofman and Thomas Hettler of The Lawrence Group. The asking rent is $57.50 per square foot.

Earlier this month, CRTKL, which designs for Nordstrom among others, was ranked as the No. 1 retail design firm for the second year in a row by Visual Merchandising and Store Design magazine.

The top 30 floors of the landmarked Woolworth Building are being converted to stunning, large condominium apartments by Ken Horn of Alchemy Properties. Its topmost pinnacle, with 9,563 square feet over eight floors, is still available for about $110 million.

It sits prominently across from City Hall Park, and its U-shaped floors provide lots of light. Designed by Cass Gilbert, the Gothic Revival skyscraper was the tallest building in the world when it opened in 1913. The Trump Building at 40 Wall St. passed it by in 1930.
