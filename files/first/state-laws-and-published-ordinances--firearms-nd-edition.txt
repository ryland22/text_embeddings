ATF is pleased to provide you with the 32nd Edition of the State Laws and Published Ordinances. This publication is designed to help Federal firearms licensees (FFL) comply with Federal and State firearms laws; specifically, with the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA). In addition, this book will assist FFLs in making lawful over-the-counter sales of rifles and shotguns to out-of-State residents, transactions that must meet the legal requirements of both the FFL's and the purchaser's State of residence. We trust you will find the provided information helpful in gaining and maintaining compliance with Federal and State level firearms laws.
