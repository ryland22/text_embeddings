There are plenty of factors to weigh-up when purchasing a new car, such as performance, fuel economy, styling, technology, and how it feels to drive, but even in 2016, reliability is still probably the biggest factor for car buyers.

It’s easy to think that there’s no such thing as an unreliable car these days, but the 2016 Driver Power survey shows that there’s still clear discrepancies between different manufacturers.

Each year the Driver Power survey asks 50,000 UK motorists to score their cars on a number of different factors – reliability included. It gives us a great idea of how the cars we test fare in the real world, and clearly shows that on UK roads some manufacturers are more reliable than others.

It’s self-reported data and there are a couple of surprises in the results alongside more predictable placers, but it does give an impression which manufacturers are leaving customers satisfied, and which ones leave something to be desired.

Here’s what the 2016 Driver Power has to say about reliability:

Most reliable car manufacturers 2016

The 2016 list of the most reliable car manufacturers contains many names we’ve come to expect to see near the top as a result of their performance in previous surveys. Japanese brands dominate the top 10 with Lexus, Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Suzuki and Subaru all making the cut.

Less predictable was Dacia’s third spot overall, proving that cutting-costs does not have to mean cutting corners on reliability. The simplicity and proven Renault mechanicals behind Dacia products appear to be counting in their favour.

The biggest surprise has to be the overall king of the most reliable car brands, however. Tesla has made a huge impact on the car industry in recent years and despite it still manufacturing a relatively small number of cars, the firm’s customers appear to be delighted with the level of reliability they’re getting. Whether things will change as more Tesla models find owners in the UK with the Model X and Model 3 becoming available remains to be seen but there’s no denying that Tesla seems to be heading in the right direction.

1. Tesla - 97.54% 2. Lexus - 97.25% 3. Dacia - 96.45% 4. Toyota - 95.03% 5. Honda - 94.61% 6. Mazda - 94.58% 7. Suzuki - 94.36% 8. Skoda - 94.35% 9. Subaru - 94.32% 10. Kia - 94.17%

Least reliable car manufacturers 2016

And so we arrive at the 'could-do-better' end of the most reliable car brands scale and the 10 least reliable car manufacturers in 2016. Propping up the table is MINI, a brand that you may not necessarily have associated with reliability issues niggling or catastrophic. Yet, MINI owners have spoken in Driver Power 2016 and they aren’t as happy as they could be.

Also finding a spot in the rogues gallery are Volkswagen and Audi, while it’s even more a surprise to see Nissan languishing down there given the strong showing from its fellow Japanese marques. It seems Fiat and Alfa Romeo still have work to do too while Land Rover has a long way to go to catch Jaguar in 17th.

23. Audi - 90.43%

24. Fiat - 90.19%

25. Hyundai - 90.15%

26. Ford - 89.91%

27. Alfa Romeo - 89.76%

28. Nissan - 89.05%

29. VW - 89.01%

30. Land Rover - 88.20%

31. Jeep - 87.93%

32. MINI - 87.09%
