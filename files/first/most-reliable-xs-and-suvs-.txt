Reliability is possibly the most coveted quality in a car. No matter how fast, economical, practical or well-equipped a vehicle is, its strengths will count for nothing if you’re stranded on the roadside or making your umpteenth trip to the garage for yet another repair job.

Given that 4x4s, SUVs and crossovers tend to be bought for their toughness and ability to cope with the stresses and strains of family transport, reliability is especially important for buyers in this sector. Therefore it’s important to find out which models are most reliable before you part with any cash, as too often issues will only become apparent when it’s too late.

That’s why the 2016 Driver Power survey is here to help. Almost 50,000 UK car owners across the country rated their cars in a range of categories, including reliability. We’ve got the results from the SUV, 4x4 and crossover class right here, and the data comes from the people who know best: Auto Express readers who’ve given us invaluable insight into which vehicles keep their owners satisfied from a reliability standpoint.

Below you’ll find our top 10 most reliable 4x4s, SUVs and crossovers based on the 2016 Driver Power results, and there’s also an interactive table giving the full rundown of all the off-roaders that featured in the survey.

1. Lexus RX Mk3 - 98.49%

The most reliable SUV is also the most reliable car overall in Driver Power 2016. The third generation Lexus RX clocked up an excellent 98.49% reliability score with owners. Any worries about how the complex hybrid powertrain fitted to many of these cars will perform over the long term appear to be unfounded with the RX showing many less advanced models how it’s done. The luxury Lexus launched in 2015 and adds a comfortable interior and generous interior space to its glowing reliability record.

2. Toyota Land Cruiser Mk7 - 98.06%

The Toyota Land Cruiser has built its reputation on never letting owners down, even in the harshest environments. It might be a little unsophisticated on the road by modern standards but you can drive it almost anywhere and it’ll get you home again afterwards. A 98.06% score for reliability shows how much owners trust their Land Cruisers and that durability extends to a spacious interior that will shrug off the knocks and scuffs picked up over the course of family life.

3. Subaru Forester Mk4 - 97.37%

Subaru is another brand with a reputation for reliability that appears to hold up in practice. The Subaru Forester majors in tough, family-friendly simplicity in a similar way to the Toyota Land Cruiser but on a smaller scale. It received an outstanding 97.37% score for reliability from owners who were also pleased with its build quality and ease of driving.

4. Lexus NX - 97.24%

It’s good to see that the newer Lexus models are continuing in the strong vein established by the brand’s longer standing product lines. The NX compact SUV has gone straight in at number four in our SUV reliability list with a 97.24% score. NX owners also appreciated the build quality, seat comfort and road handling but were less keen on the running costs.

5. Lexus RX Mk2 - 96.90%

The second generation Lexus RX was sold between 2003 and 2008 but it’s still delivering the goods as far as owners are concerned. With the third generation RX in first place and the smaller NX in fourth, the RX Mk 2 completes a trio of Lexus models in our most reliable SUVs top 5. Seat comfort, performance and ease of driving were also praised by owners but running costs were less of a highlight.

6. Toyota RAV4 Mk4

The current RAV4 has dropped 10 places in the overall Driver Power standings this year, but it’s firmly within the top 10 SUVs for reliability. It also scores well for the usual Toyota mainstay of build quality, plus the compact SUV puts in a good performance for practicality, courtesy of its spacious interior and big boot, which has a 100-litre storage area under the floor. Running costs are a problem, though; owners don’t think the 2.0-litre petrol and diesel engines – or even the hybrid – are particularly economical.

7. Mazda CX-3

Image 8 of 11 Image 8 of 11

The Mazda CX-3 is off to a good start with a debut inside the overall Driver Power top 50 as well as this top 10 SUV reliability list. The small SUV has been a hit with early owners on the tech front, as it comes with DAB, Bluetooth and a seven-inch infotainment touchscreen. Predictably for a Mazda, road handling and reliability rank strongly, as does build quality. A shortage of space for rear passengers and the small boot have earned a poor practicality score, and you told us the petrol and diesel engines are more expensive to run than expected.

8. Renault Captur

Image 9 of 11 Image 9 of 11

After debuting in ninth place overall two years ago, Renault’s small SUV tumbled down the rankings last year. However, it has rebounded in 2016 with higher scores in every single category including reliability. Renault has put a lot of effort into improving reliability on newer models and it seems to be paying off. Running costs are the Captur’s strongest suit, with low insurance group ratings combining with fuel-efficient diesel and petrol engines. Owners are generally pleased with the Captur’s all-round abilities.

9. Subaru XV

Image 10 of 11 Image 10 of 11

The Subaru XV finished in 130th place overall in Driver Power 2016 as a result of mediocre scores in a lot of categories but Subaru’s compact SUV was a hit when it came to reliability and only eight SUVs did better according to owners. The XV is certainly tough and performs better off road than most compact SUVs but the on-road ride is choppy and the interior is a bit rough around the edges.

10. Skoda Yeti Mk1 - 95.51%

Image 11 of 11 Image 11 of 11

It’s won Driver Power three times and never failed to make the podium in its previous five years in the chart, but the Skoda Yeti is finally showing its age as it drops to 16th place overall. At least its reliability score is holding up with 95.51% seeing it squeeze into the top 10.

Owners tell us the chunky SUV is well built, reliable and easy to drive. A facelift in 2014 helped keep in-car tech up to date, and while the boxy shape isn’t to all tastes, it clearly makes the car incredibly practical. The Yeti isn’t due to be replaced until 2018, so Skoda will be pleased to see owners still rate it as such a good new and used buy.
