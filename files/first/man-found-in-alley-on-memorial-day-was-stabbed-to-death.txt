The death of a Trenton man whose "badly decomposing" body was found in an alley on Memorial Day has been ruled a homicide, the Mercer County Prosecutor's Office said Wednesday.

The medical examiner's office identified him as a 56-year-old from Trenton who had been stabbed to death. Authorities are withholding his name as they attempt to find his family, the prosecutor's office said.

His body was found on Monday near the intersection of Taylor and Poplar streets around 4:23 p.m.

The prosecutor's office has not yet commented on how long they suspect he was dead.

The investigation is still ongoing, and no arrests have been made.

Anyone with information is encouraged to contact Mercer County Homicide Task Force Sgt. Gary Wasko or Detective Roberto Reyes at 609-989-6406.
