February 1, 1983 Seven of the 12 hot-air balloons that took part in commemorating the 200th anniversary of the first piloted balloon flight. The balloonists from Rochester, New Prague, St. Paul and Minneapolis flew from the state capitol in St. Paul to Woodbury in about two hours.

Matt Wiederkeher, a hot-air balloon distributor in St. Paul, who organized the flight, said it was the first official flight of the U.S. Air and Space Bicentennial.

“There’s no doubt it was a great honor for Minnesota,” he said. “We continue to reach for the stars, but during the bicentennial year we need to look at where we’ve been to see where we’re going.“ Bruce Bisping, Minneapolis Star Tribune
