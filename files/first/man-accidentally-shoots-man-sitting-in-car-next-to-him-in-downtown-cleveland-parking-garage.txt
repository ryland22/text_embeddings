CLEVELAND, Ohio -- A 31-year-old man is charged with illegally carrying a gun after he accidentally shot a man sitting in his car in a nearby parking space in a downtown Cleveland parking garage.

Rico Ivy of Cleveland is charged with carrying a concealed weapon. He was released from the city jail after posting a $5,000 bond on Tuesday.

The shooting happened 3 a.m. Sunday on West St. Clair Avenue and West 3rd Street, across the street from the Cuyahoga County Justice Center that houses Cleveland police headquarters.

Ivy told police he was standing outside his car on the driver's side when he went to put his gun on to his passenger seat, according to police.

He accidentally pulled the trigger and a bullet ripped through his car. A 32-year-old man was sitting his car parked in the space next to Ivy. The bullet hit him in the lower back, according to police reports.

Ivy flagged down police officers and told them he needed help, police reports said. He led them back to his car, where the man sat after being shot.

The 32-year-old man was taken to MetroHealth. Police found Ivy's gun in his car and a fired bullet casing on the ground between the two men's cars, police reports say.
