By Lindy Kirkland, President, The Air Care Alliance

First, let me say a big thank you for helping make the Volunteer Pilot Safety Stand Down (Sit up?) a big success. All the comments I heard from pilots attending were very positive and encouraging. I also appreciate AOPA promoting Public Benefit Flying by providing a summary of the event on e-Pilot today. While the Air Care Alliance was very proud and honored to be a part of this great event, the real credit for its success goes to Steve Craven and Angel Flight Mid Atlantic. Steve was the one who developed the initial concept and approached NTSB with the idea of this event. Angel Flight Mid Atlantic was responsible for coordination and planning and provided the website for registration. I just want to ensure the appropriate folks get recognized for their great work.
