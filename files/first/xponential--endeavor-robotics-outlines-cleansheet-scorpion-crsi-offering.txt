Endeavor Robotics’ Scorpion, its system competing for the US Army’s Common Robotic System-Individual (CRS-I) platform, is a clean-sheet design for a tracked vehicle with flippers, CEO Sean Bielat told Jane’s .

CRS-I is the largest programme of record to date that the US Army established in the ground robotics space aside from the cancelled Future Combat Systems (FCS) programme, which had robot components.

Endeavor Robotics and QinetiQ were downselected for CRS-I’s engineering and manufacturing development phase, and each contractor will deliver ‘run-off test assets’ for evaluation in September or October.

Bielat could not provide specifics given the competitive nature of the CRS-I programme.
