At this point, manufacturers have engineered lawnmower blades that handle two or three operations very well, if not perfectly. That way, if the homeowner does change his mind—as you have—in most cases he doesn’t need to also change his blade.

Assuming your blade is sharp and balanced, many times all you need to do is adjust two variables on your mower:

1. Raise the deck to an appropriate level relative to grass type and height, while attempting to remove no more than a third of the height of the grass’s leaf. (Yes, it’s called a leaf, not a blade.)

2. Slow the mower’s ground speed—or your walking speed—to allow more thorough mulching action.
