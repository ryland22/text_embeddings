How hot is it Tuesday? Hot enough that Detroit students are getting an early dismissal.

The Detroit Public Schools Community District shut down schools three hours early Tuesday.

"The early dismissal is due to high temperatures developing into the afternoon," district spokeswoman Chrystal Wilson said in a media alert.

The email noted that, "If your school/student has a scheduled field trip, buses will return at their normal time and students will be transported to their corner stop or home as normally scheduled."

The high Tuesday is expected near 90. Many school buildings in the district lack air conditioning.
