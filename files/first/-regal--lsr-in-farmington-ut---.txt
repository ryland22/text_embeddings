Description..-

Super clean interior, and has always been kept covered since purchased

Recently installed a brand new High-Flow Headers on it with quick Drain Plugs

Have always ran on Mobil 1 Oil and WIX Filters

Professionally Winterized every year.



Note. The Dual-Axle Trailer is a bit rusty, but got a quote for Powder-coating it and is quite reasonable too...! Runs perfect! This will be a good boat for your Family for a long time. Have LOVED every bit of her since owned!



This is a must see Power Boat and everything within works well
