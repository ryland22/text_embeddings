When a Bay Area county decided to pass a law that effectively banned gun shows from its fairgrounds, it sparked one of the nation’s longest running legal battles over the right to bear arms.

In the end, the county conceded and the gun shows were allowed to resume under stricter rules, leaving some of the central constitutional questions around the issue unsettled.

Once again, gun shows at publicly-owned convention centers and fairgrounds are being targeted for expulsion around the state. And the legal roadmap is no less clear.

History around such efforts shows a mix of outcomes, marked at times by a lack of political support for such bans and protracted litigation ending in shrugs. And renewed pushes for gun show bans — from Del Mar to the Bay Area — would seem to face similar uncertainty.

“They are stepping into a lion’s den here of potential litigation over this,” said Chuck Michel, a prominent gun rights attorney in Long Beach and president of the California Rifle and Pistol Association.

The potential for a court battle is weighing heavily on the Del Mar Fairground’s board of directors, who will be officially considering the issue in September.

They are aware of the drawn-out Alameda County case that bounced around the courts for 12 years before ending at the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeal cost millions of dollars in legal fees.

“We can’t afford to have that kind of fight on our hands,” said Stephen Shewmaker, president of the fairground’s board of directors.

Culture clash

Just about every weekend of the year, a gun show can be found in a fairground or convention center somewhere in California.

Last weekend it was here, one of five annual events run by Crossroads of the West Gun Show at the Del Mar Fairgrounds. It’s come for the past 28 years.

Next weekend it will be in Costa Mesa at the OC Fair and Event Center, and the weekend after that at Daly City’s Cow Palace fairgrounds.

The shows draw thousands of gun enthusiasts and their families who plop down money for parking and entrance fees. Shoppers roam booths selling firearms, of course, but also ammunition, holsters and scopes next to used books, jewelry, leather goods and posters.

In many ways, California gun shows are markedly different than others across the country. Most notably, no one heading home with a new gun in hand.

California law requires gun show sales to follow the same rules as gun shops: firearms transactions can only be made through federal licensed dealers, background checks are a must, and a 10-day waiting period to take possession of a newly purchased gun remains in place.

Gun shows have always drawn their detractors, but scrutiny intensified with Columbine — especially after it was discovered that two of the weapons used in the Colorado massacre were purchased by a friend of the shooters’ from unlicensed sellers at a gun show in 1998.

The scrutiny — and frequency and deadliness of such indiscriminate mass shootings — has only increased since.

“This issue is a classic clash of cultures,” said Donald Kilmer, who represented the gun show operators in the Alameda County case.

Promotion of the gun culture is what worries many gun control advocates the most, making gun shows a prime target.

“We are not opposed to gun shows, per se,” said Carol Landale, president of the San Diego chapter of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, applauding California’s stringent rules.

But Landale, who walked the aisles of Del Mar’s gun show last weekend, said she was troubled by the children being exposed to a culture that revolves around violent weapons, as well as immediate safety concerns with the display of guns and knives and what she said seemed to be a lack of oversight.

“If we stop glorifying guns, it’s one step in the right direction toward reducing gun violence,” she said. “Obviously it’s not the only step. It’s complicated, so many things need to be done. But it’s just one small effort that can help.”

Despite California’s strict rules governing gun shows, critics worry that the gatherings connect buyers and sellers who make unlawful, off-the-books gun transactions.

“We have to shut this down, our society is being ripped apart by this,” said Rose Ann Sharp said of the nation’s gun violence. The Del Mar resident, along with her husband, has spearheaded the most recent gun show ban effort. “It’s the most natural place to start.”

Gun rights advocates bristle at the characterization that they say demonizes gun owners.

“There are people frustrated with criminals and criminal activity who have made the headlines, and I totally understand that,” said Michael Schwartz, CEO of San Diego County Gun Owners, a pro-gun political action committee that has waded into the Del Mar debate. “But they are taking it out on law-abiding people, and shutting down a gun show is not going to save a life and not going to prevent crime. All you do is send the message to a group of people exercising their rights telling them ‘You are undesirable.’”

Michel, the attorney who specializes in Second Amendment law, noted many events are held on public property that don’t match his values or viewpoints. “So what?” he said.

“This is classic viewpoint discrimination,” Michel said. “Thousands and thousands of gun owners are law-abiding. Good citizen gun owners go to shows for entertainment, education, good deals.”

A call for change

It’s this polarized landscape that the state’s 22nd District Agricultural Association, which oversees the Del Mar Fairgrounds, must navigate.

Calls for a gun show ban have grown increasingly louder over the past few years, and board meetings have recently drawn crowds from both sides who argue their points during spirited public comment periods.

The issue of a gun show ban is now set for official consideration on the September agenda, and a separate meeting eliciting public comment will likely be held to accommodate the oversized, impassioned crowd expected to attend.

Another, more immediate wrinkle has also surfaced. At a meeting last week, it was brought to the board’s attention that the family who owns the Crossroads show has a felonious background of gun convictions.

Patriarch Bob Templeton, 79, who founded the show, was indicted in 1980 on charges of unlawful sales of firearms, making a false statement and aiding and abetting, according to a 1994 story in the Deseret News. The case involved the shipment of firearms to Mormons in South Africa.

Templeton pleaded guilty to one count of unlawfully selling a .38 caliber revolver out of state, was sentenced to probation and successfully petitioned to have his gun possession rights restored despite the felony conviction.
