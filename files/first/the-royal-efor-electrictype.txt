Among the parade of outsize Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers designed more for passenger visibility than elegance, one car stood out this month at the royal wedding: a two-seat Jaguar E-Type with a unique electric conversion.

Prince Harry drove his new wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, to their evening wedding party in the modernized 1968 convertible and in doing so gifted Jaguar an untold amount of positive publicity.

The car, called the Concept Zero, is owned by Jaguar and was created last year to draw attention to Jaguar Land Rover's Classic Works business, which restores models from its back catalog. It also neatly draws a line between Jaguar's illustrious sports car past and its future electric direction, shown by the I-Pace electric crossover launching this year.

The E-Type electric conversion is a one-off and not registered for use on public roads. Prince Harry drove it on the private grounds of Windsor Castle to the couple's reception.

Jaguar claims that by swapping out the straight-six engine for a 220-kW (295-hp) electric motor, the car is faster than the original, hitting 60 mph from standing in 5.5 seconds. The conversion was done on a North American Series 1.5 E-Type with the steering wheel on the left, leading to a lot of Brits initially wondering if the new Duchess of Sussex was going to be driving.

Jaguar has totted up the total cost of the car and the engine swap at around Â£300,000 ($400,500) and is mulling whether to offer it as an official conversion. A spokesman said: "There's been a lot of very positive noises. It's quite an appealing prospect."
