It is a known fact that Houston is a melting pot thanks to its pulsating diversity. The South Asian community is making its presence felt in several service industries, health care, technology and business, along with influencing and shaping legal and governmental policy.

There’s a population of about 200,000 South Asians – with the Indian community in particular working towards the integration of Eastern values within the Western domain. As this population ages, they are realizing how much Houston has become home to them, but the limitation of resources catering to to their social and cultural fabric needs consideration. As they grow older, there is a sense of displacement that cannot be just an empty-nest syndrome. The culture focuses on family, and after the kids are grown, married, and leading their own lives, there is a what-next feeling among these adults who have lived their lives ensuring a better life for their next generation.

As the population ages, they want to live well and stay close to their loved ones, but with a lower-maintenance lifestyle that would cater to their needs. However, Shaun Vembutty, the founder and principal at Ashton Gray Development, felt that while the target demographic wanted to downsize, they still wanted to live somewhere visually appealing and upscale. His company specializes in luxury spec home development and he knew exactly the kind of product and design he needed to implement in a community like this.

Most of all, Vembutty wants to keep the spirit of these people alive by celebrating their contribution to this society and giving them a platform to do more. Taj will be a place where family and friendships will be the pavers to these luxury homes. The essence is to treat this demographic as the crown jewels of the community, and that’s what “Taj” means. In addition to that, he wanted to create a residential community that was very elegant and upscale in aesthetics.

Taj Residences offers floor plans ranging from 1,500 to 1,850 sq. ft . The homes feature open floor plans with three bedrooms, two full baths, a powder bath, private study, attached garage and a garden. Luxury features include marble countertops, Bosch appliances, a walk-in shower, his and hers closets and custom cabinetry.

Features like security cameras and shatter-proof glass keep the homeowners safe, while exterior features such as solid, heavily inspected foundations, 100 percent wood sheathing, moisture-barrier house wraps, double-pane windows and pex plumbing ensure each home’s longevity and stability. Also, the location did not flood during Hurricane Harvey, and that’s because of smart design, not luck.

There’s a great energy in the community about this development not limited to local residents but buyers from other states and international buyers. One of the buyers, Mr. Mallik Putcha adds, “We are very pleased with the floor plans, food arrangements, security, and management. The location is a plus. It is very close to the town center, HEB, Target, and Hospital. We expect Taj to be the Cadillac of the Retirement Community in Indo-American society.” Dr. Ravi Tamerisa also shares the same sentiment, “This type of facility was long overdue in Houston and we are so happy to be a part of it now. The entire team made us feel at ease and answered all our questions. We know we will be well taken care of here and can’t wait to move into our new HOME.”

First-class amenities

Residents who are tired of cooking can sign up for the dining plan, which provides vegetarian-only meals served in the elegant dining hall. Housekeeping services, linen service, and professional landscaping mean residents spend less time on chores and more time pursuing hobbies and passions. When needed, the community can make sure your medication is delivered and arrange for nurse visits.





The 8,000 square-foot, multi-million-dollar clubhouse offers the space and facilities to bring residents together. Relax with a cup of tea in the lounge, play cards with other residents in the game-room, watch the latest blockbuster in the theater room, or fit in a workout in the fitness center. The clubhouse also houses a meditation hall for when residents need a space for spiritual reflection.

Close to shopping and hospitals

Located on 10 scenic acres in Richmond, Texas, the Taj Residences development has easy access to Highways 99, Alt 90, Hwy 6 and Hwy 59. You’ll find a Target and an HEB grocery along with several other retailers right across the street, not to mention the up-and-coming Waterview Town Center just a few steps away. Local hospitals are just a few minutes away.

More than half the homes in the development are already presold. With prices in the low to mid $300,000s, Vembutty expects to be completely sold out very soon and considers that a testament to the amount of thought and effort his firm has put into the design and the amenities.
