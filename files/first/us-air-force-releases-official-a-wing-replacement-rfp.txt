The US Air Force released on 25 May its official request for proposals to replace 112 wing sets on its Fairchild Republic A-10 fleet.

The indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract will have a basic five-year ordering period beginning at contract award, two one-year optional ordering periods thereafter, and a four-year delivery period following the end of the ordering periods, according to the RFP notice.

The contract is for a minimum of four wing sets. It has a maximum of 112 wing sets and 15 spare kits.

The USAF is requesting a response by June 22. Production delivery is to start no later than April 2019, according to the notice.

The USAF launched the re-winging programme for the A-10 fleet in 2006 with a contract award to Boeing. The company completed upgrades on six of the nine A-10 squadrons still in operations in January 2018, but made a business decision not to continue working on the programme, according to the USAF.
