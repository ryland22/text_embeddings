WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Annual operations to curb overabundant white-tailed deer at several national parks in Maryland and Washington, D.C. has netted more than 14,000 pounds of venison.

WTOP-FM reported Monday that the deer culling took place at Rock Creek Park in the district as well as Antietam National Battle Field, Catoctin Mountain Park and Monocacy National Battlefield in Maryland.

The venison was donated to the Maryland Food Bank, the Thurmont Food Bank and DC Central Kitchen.

A National Park Service news release says the deer meat is professionally processed and tested for chronic wasting disease before being donated.

The park service says overabundant deer populations do immense damage to vegetation and eat nearly all tree seedlings. The news release says deer also damage agricultural crops.
