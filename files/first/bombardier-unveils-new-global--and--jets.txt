Bombardier Unveils New Global 6500 and 5500 Jets

Bombardier’s unveiling of the new Global 5500 and 6500 was quite a surprise to the crowd at EBACE in Geneva, as the company had kept the programs completely top secret. The new aircraft will join the Global 5000 and 6000 on the production lines rather than supplanting them, and they will be powered by new 15,125-pound-thrust Rolls-Royce Pearl engines. Beyond the engines, the aircraft incorporate a host of new features, including improved aerodynamics, interior appointments, and avionics updates.

Another notable feature in the new aircraft is the Rockwell Collins Fusion-powered Vision flight deck’s combined vision system head-up display. The Global 6500 and 5500 are the business aviation launch application of the Rockwell Collins combined vision system, which merges infrared enhanced vision and synthetic vision system imagery into a single conformal view.
