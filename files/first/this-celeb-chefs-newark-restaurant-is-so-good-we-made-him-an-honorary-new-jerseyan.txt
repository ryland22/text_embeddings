A celebrity chef opened a restaurant in Newark, and we're all still trying to figure out what it means.

For Newark and the state, it at least means someone from outside likes us, really likes us! (Are you listening, Amazon?) It’s also another sign of the new Newark story being told — development is up, crime is down and there’s lots to see and do here in this city that was once called the unfriendliest place in the world.

For Marcus Samuelsson, it means doing what he's done before. When the Food Network chef opened his restaurant Red Rooster in Harlem in 2010, some called him crazy, imagining that Manhattan diners wouldn't venture there, even for a superstar who served the Obamas’ first state dinner. Try to get a table at Red Rooster today and you'll see who got the last laugh.

It also means being a mentor, filling 80 percent of his staff with Newark residents, trying to give back and shunning that whole “celebrity” thing.

When I ask about the pressure of being dubbed “a restaurant that’s going to transform the city,” Samuelsson demurs, remembering how he got here. The Ethiopian-born chef was adopted by a Swedish family and worked in Europe before finding fame in NYC.

"I still remember the day I came to this country with 300 bucks," he says with a laugh. "Now that was pressure."
