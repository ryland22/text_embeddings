Uber is holding its Uber Elevate Summit this week at the Skirball Center in Los Angeles, where industry leaders are discussing the future of metropolitan air transportation. Two well-established GA manufacturers, Slovenia's Pipistrel and Brazil's Embraer, revealed conceptual eVTOL designs at this year’s Summit.

Embraer unveiled its eVTOL concept under the company’s subsidiary EmbraerX. While no details were announced, EmbraerX said its key targets are safety, passenger experience, affordability and a low noise and emissions footprint.

Pipistrel, meanwhile, announced that it will develop its eVTOL model with another Slovenian company, Elan, which has become a leader in composite manufacturing for a variety of products including sporting equipment and power plant components for windmills.
