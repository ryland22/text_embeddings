After causing flash floods throughout the southern United States, subtropical storm Alberto is expected to strike Detroit this afternoon. However, the damage will be far less severe in Michigan than in other states, the National Weather Service predicts.

Pop-up showers have already begun to make appearances throughout the region but the weather service only expects isolated storms and thunderstorms, beginning around 4 or 5 p.m. and ending by 5 a.m. tomorrow. The flooding advisory for lake shores in Huron, Sanilac and St. Clair counties is unlikely to be upgraded and there is only a “very minimal chance of short-lived tornadoes,” meteorologist Alex Manion of the National Weather Service in White Lake told the Free Press.

The most noticeable effects of the storm system – besides the rain – will be the high amount of moisture in the air. Manion said that while the moisture won't necessarily cause rainfall, the moisture levels will be at or near record highs.

Rain could continue over the coming days but the storm system isn’t expected to have an effect on temperatures, with an estimated high tomorrow of 88 degrees.

As the weekend approaches, an unrelated cold front is forecasted to cool down the region – a high of 80 on Friday will drop to 72 degrees on Saturday.
