It could be true. It could also be a PR stunt.

Nevertheless, Nicki Minaj is saying it: The star singer, rapper and songwriter says she's dating Eminem.

In the wee hours of Friday morning, Minaj posted an Instagram video of herself rapping in a new YG song, titled "Big Bank," also featuring Big Sean (a Detroit native) and 2 Chainz, to her 86.8 million followers.

"Toldâ€™em I met Slim Shady. Bagged a EM!!!," she wrote in the post, referring to the Detroit rapper.

This prompted a fan to ask if Minaj was dating Eminem. She directly replied: "yes".

(WARNING: Video contains some explicit language.)

It's a real comment; you can find it on the Instagram post. Again, there's no real confirmation if she's telling the truth or just joking around, but she's at least saying it.

Eminem told Vulture last December that he's had a few dates since his divorce with Kim Mathers, but said "it's tough" and that "nothing's panned out in a way that I wanted to make it public."

He also said he uses Tinder, a popular dating app, though it was unclear if he was joking. He also said in the same interview that he uses Grindr and used to go to strip clubs to meet women.

Minaj has an album coming soon, called "Queen," but said on Instagram Live on Thursday that the release has been delayed until August.
