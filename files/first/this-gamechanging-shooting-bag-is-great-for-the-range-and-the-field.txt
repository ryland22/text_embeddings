Over a Fence: The bag can change nearly any fence into a solid rest. It can be draped over the rail of a jack fence or a strand of fence wire, or set flat-side down on top of a post.

The Game Changer doesn’t look all that different from other rifle-rest sandbags. It has a flat base, two pointed ears, a carry handle on each end, and four plastic attachments to thread nylon straps through. It isn’t filled to capacity and slouches when you set it down, kind of like a surly teenager who doesn’t want to talk about why his homework isn’t getting done.

But, as is often the case, first impressions aren’t everything. There’s a lot going on with this unassuming little bag, which has become a very popular accessory with competitive shooters in the Precision Rifle Series.

The bag’s shape along with the type and volume of fill were well thought out by Clifton Reasor, who created it. When Tom Fuller, a competitive shooter who owns Armageddon Gear, saw it, he liked it so much that he entered into a partnership with Reasor to produce them and meet the growing demand ($109; Armageddon Gear).

The qualities that make the bag attractive to competitive shooters also make it a great option for hunters, as I learned last fall when I started carrying one around with me.

The real genius of the Game Changer is its versatility. Its slouching quality allows it to conform to a surprising variety of surfaces. With the ears pointed down, the bag can be draped over a tree branch, a spotting scope on a tripod, or a fence post, just to name a few options. Positioned this way, the bag creates a flat support to balance a rifle on. When you use it on a flat surface—like a rock, a backpack, or the top of a table—set the flat side down and cradle the rifle between the ears. Either way, the bag holds the rifle firmly in place.
