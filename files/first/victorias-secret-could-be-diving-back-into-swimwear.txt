Victoria’s Secret may dip its toe back into the swimsuit business, after all.

The struggling lingerie giant’s wishy-washy executives admitted to Wall Street analysts on Thursday they were considering backtracking on a controversial decision to exit swimwear in 2016.

“There is discussion about bringing back swim from time to time,” Stuart Burgdoerfer, chief financial officer of Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands, said on a conference call.

That’s despite the fact that swimsuits were even less profitable for the chain than bras and panties. Just a few months ago, management had said its teen-focused Pink chain would stop selling swimsuits within a year.

“I believe there is some internal debate about swimwear,” Citi analyst Paul Lejuez, who had raised the question on Thursday’s call, told The Post. “Several senior executives would like to bring it back.”

Lejuez noted that the company has recently backtracked on previous decisions to get rid of promotional mailers. Meanwhile, its catalog was brought back as a so-called “magalog” just two weeks ago.

“They underestimated the impact swimsuits had on bringing people to their stores,” said A-Line Partners founder Gabriella Santaniello. “It was a reason for customers to shop in the stores in the spring and summer, and now they are trying to achieve the same sales number with promotions.”

The chain’s pricey constructed push-up bras, which can run upwards of $50, have been losing ground to comfier bralettes from rivals like American Eagle Outfitters’ lower-priced Aerie brand.

The chain also has gotten dinged by the #MeToo movement for its overreliance on sexy models to sell intimates.
