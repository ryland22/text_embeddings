Decked out with modern looks and nifty features like a hook for bags of carryout food, the ★★★★ 2019 XC40 compact SUV was designed for young professionals who can’t imagine why anybody would want to drive off-road, and it’s good.

The accommodating five-seater delivers value, safety and efficiency. Volvo expects most buyers to be women, but anybody looking for a small luxury SUV should consider it.

The XC40 is based on Volvo’s new compact model architecture (CMA), which will spin off a range of vehicles. That will include 40-series sedans and station wagons in other parts of the world, but those models may not make it to the SUV-crazed U.S.

Hybrid and electric models will be available later.

The CMA is Volvo’s second architecture. The bigger scalable product architecture, or SPA, underpins the XC90 and XC60 SUVs and 90- and 60-series sedans and wagons.

Behind the Wheel

2019 Volvo XC40 T5 AWD R-Design

Four-wheel-drive, compact luxury SUV

Price as tested: $44,840 (excluding destination charge)

Rating: ★★★★ (Out of four stars)

Reasons to buy: Looks; features; fuel economy

Shortcomings: Engine idle-stop; touch screen response; unconventional shifter

How much?

The XC40 competes with small luxury SUVs like the Audi Q3, BMW X1 and X2, Infiniti QX30, Jaguar E-Pace, Land Rover Evoque and Mercedes GLA.

XC40 prices start at $33,200 for a front-wheel-drive model that will be on sale shortly. All-wheel-drive XC40s start at $35,200. The top XC40 Inscription model starts at $39,750.

Front- and all-wheel-drive XC40s both have a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, but AWD models get a higher-output T5 turbocharger and develop 248 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, compared with 187 hp and 221 pound-feet for the T4 base model.

I tested a very well-equipped AWD XC40 T5 AWD R-Design. It had all the latest driver aids, including semi-autonomous Pilot Assist with adaptive cruise control, lane-departure alert and assist; blind-spot alert; collision alert; automatic braking; pedestrian and bicycle alerts; and 360-degree backup cameras. Other features included leather upholstery with Nubuck inserts, Harman Kardon audio, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, panoramic sunroof and more.

It stickered at $44,840. All prices exclude destination prices.

XC40 prices are competitive with other small luxury SUVs, but the Volvo offers safety and driver assistance features the others can’t match, and gets better fuel economy.

Outstanding features

The XC40’s calling card is a comprehensive set of safety and driver assistance features, but it’s loaded with goodies for comfort and convenience, too.

First and foremost, the sum total of its driver assistance features amounts to what Volvo calls Pilot Assist, allowing the XC40 to follow vehicles and stay in its lane on the highway with very little intervention as long as the driver keeps a hand on the steering wheel.

Pilot Assist’s lane-centering is not as smooth and unobtrusive as Nissan’s Pro Pilot Plus — we’ll all be sick of branded “pilot this” and “pilot that” systems before automakers get tired of trying to pretend their system is unique. Despite that, Volvo’s system is another step toward making the new safety and assistance features ubiquitous.

A little hook folds out from the glove box door for the handles of bags of carryout meals, an appealing feature the XC40’s target mostly single and child-free audience will probably appreciate.

I tested both the XC40 R-Design and slightly lower priced Momentum trim level. The interiors of both look great, with soft touch materials on nearly every surface, ambient lighting and attractive concave trim panels with unusual trim that looked like three-dimensional pieces of metal.

The exterior design is contemporary and recognizable, with a long hood, upswept rear fender and scalloped doors. Paint schemes include attractive two-tones with contrasting black or white roofs.

Volvo offers innovative leasing plans that include service and insurance for $600 and $700 a month.

The downside

The engine’s stop-start or idle stop system, which shuts the power plant off when idling at stop signs and in traffic, is more obtrusive than the best competitors offer. The car shakes noticeably on stop and restart. Restart is a bit slow.

Those faults will probably lead a lot of owners to disable the system, reducing fuel economy and increasing emissions.

Volvo’s handsome iPad-style touch screen in the center console is among the largest in the auto industry, particularly for a small vehicle like the XC40, but its response time could stand improvement.

This may be the one hitch in Volvo’s plan to share major vehicle systems and components among all its vehicles: The touch screen was clearly industry-leading when it debuted in the XC90 large SUV, but that was three years ago. Response times that were great then seem sluggish versus today’s best systems. The screen is still big and the system intuitive, but adjusting fan speed and a some other tasks seem cumbersome.

The shift lever is small and has an unusual mechanism: push forward twice quickly for drive, push rear twice quickly for reverse, and a button for park.

Specifications as tested

Engine: 2.0L turbocharged 16-valve 4-cylinder

Power: 248 horsepower at 5,500 rpm with premium fuel; 258 pound-feet of torque at 1,800-4,800 rpm

Transmission: 8-speed automatic

Wheelbase: 106.4 inches

Length: 174.2 inches

Width: 75.2 inches

Height: 65.3 inches

Curb Weight: 3,729 lbs.

Where assembled: Ghent, Belgium

Facts and figures

The T5’s 248 hp 2.0L is more powerful than all the competitors but Jag’s E-Pace, which nips it by 1 hp. The engine’s 258 pound-feet of torque also trails the Jag, this time by a conceivably perceptible 11 pound-feet. More important, the Volvo’s peak torque doesn’t become available till 1,800 rpm, higher than most of the competition. The XC40’s 3,756-pound curb weight is also among the heaviest in the segment.

The result is acceleration that’s fine for passing and highway cruising, but not exhilarating.

Like many new SUVs, the SC40 makes no pretense to off-road ability, despite 8.3 inches of ground clearance.

The steering is firm, responsive and adjustable. The suspension absorbs bumps well and keeps the relatively tall vehicle level and planted in quick maneuvers.

Volvo rather clearly left the door open for a more powerful and expensive SC40 with the company’s 316-hp engine if demand warrants.

Either the expected plug-in hybrid or electric model could also provide a performance model, if demand warrants.

The EPA rated the T5 XC40 at 23 m.p.g. in town, 31 on the highway and 26 combined. The key combined figure is best in class, matching the GLA250, 1 m.p.g. better than the QX30, X2 and Evoque, 2 m.p.g. more than E-Pace and 3 m.p.g. better than Q3.
