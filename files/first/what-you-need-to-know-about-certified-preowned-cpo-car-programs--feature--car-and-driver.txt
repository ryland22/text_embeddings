It’s not all a conspiracy contrived to take your money, however. Buying a two-year-old CPO vehicle typically saves buyers about 25 percent versus the cost of a brand-new version. Four-year-old CPO models are often marked down by as much as 40 percent compared with new and, unlike most used vehicles, some CPO cars now offer leasing as an option through certified dealerships. As with new cars, leasing a CPO vehicle should substantially lower the monthly payment. CPO vehicles also offer customers some peace of mind in a market where they are otherwise expected to trust @hondaluvr89 not to lie about the condition of the Honda Civic he got as a hand-me-down from his uncle who bought it “almost new” from some guy in East Whereverstan. Indeed, every CPO program evaluates its vehicles using a manufacturer-specific checklist, most of which encompass approximately 150 points or so (Audi’s checklist numbers more than 300 points!). And nearly every program provides a vehicle-history report as proof that the car has led an uneventful life. It’s a good idea to ask the dealer for a copy of the program’s CPO checklist to get an idea of what they’re looking for.
