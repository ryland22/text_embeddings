A new partnership between Rockwell Collins and Comlux will see the two companies providing complete nose-to-tail solutions for VIP aircraft.

Under the five-year deal announced today, Rockwell Collins will provide its business aviation customers with avionics, cabin management, content and entertainment options, seating, lighting and galley products, as well as ArincDirect connectivity and flight services.

Engineering work on the first two aircraft – a Boeing Business Jet retrofit and a BBJ Max – is already under way at Comlux’s Indianapolis facility.

“Through our agreement and exclusive access to Rockwell Collins’ extensive product portfolio, we can perform optimum completion cycles and operational balance without compromising the design and level of elegance of our VIP cabins,” says Complux Completion chief executive Scott Meyer.

“We are able to provide cost-efficient solutions in terms of cabin technology, warranty and spares, and we ensure our customers enjoy the best VIP cabin experience over the entire life cycle of their aircraft, not only the completion.”

In addition to providing solutions for all Comlux completions and retrofit projects, Rockwell Collins will gain access to its charter fleet for the design validation and certification of new products.

Scott Gunnufson, Rockwell Collins vice-president commercial systems business development, sales and marketing, describes the deal as “the first VIP of this magnitude for our company”.
