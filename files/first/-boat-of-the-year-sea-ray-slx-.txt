Boating’s Boat of the Year is the most prestigious honor awarded to recreational boatbuilders. For 2017, the Sea Ray SLX 400 joins the pantheon of great boats that can claim the title of Boat of the Year . Congratulations!

Boating’s Boat of the Year is not decided by ­favorites — advertising dollars spent do not equate to qualification points for the award. Nor does favoritism among boaters play a role; a boat (or anything, really) could be sold in great numbers without being great. No, it’s not as simple as that. Just as a box-office smash film may not win an Oscar, and just as a Heisman-trophy-winning player may not make it to the championship, the title of Boat of the Year is earned by merits deeper than simply economics and popularity. (But successful, popular boats can garner the award.)
