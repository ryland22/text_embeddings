Want to upgrade your earring game for spring? The choice is clear: Try lucite!

Designer Alison Chemla of Alison Lou — known for whimsical wares such as emoji pendants and mushroom-shaped stud earrings — just dropped a new capsule collection of hoop earrings called LOUCITE.

Hollywood is already obsessed. The sheer stunners have only been out for a month, and they’ve already been worn by a smattering of stars, including Jennifer Lopez and Alicia Keys.

As the collection’s famous fans have proved, the pieces are ultraversatile: They go just as well with a full-skirted feminine dress (à la Blake Lively) as they do with a retro, sporty windbreaker (as seen on Gabrielle Union).

The small-size earrings go for $125, the medium for $145 and the largest for $165. You can also score a set of three pairs for $395, packaged in a chic, clear plastic tote.

Stargazers, take note: Celeb-loved styles, including Selena Gomez’s small white pair, are currently on pre-order.
