Saudi Aramco and Total have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to build a $9bn petrochemical complex in Jubail, Saudi Arabia, next to the SATORP refinery.

Set to be integrated downstream of the refinery in a bid to fully exploit operational synergies, the complex will comprise a mixed-feed steam cracker with an annual capacity of 1.5 million tonnes of ethylene and associated petrochemical units.

The capacity of SATORP refinery has increased from 400,000bpd at its start-up in 2014 to 440,000bpd. The refinery is a joint venture between Saudi Aramco (62.5%) and Total (37.5%).



“This project illustrates our strategy of maximising the integration of our large refining and petrochemical platforms.”

Total chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanné said: “This project illustrates our strategy of maximising the integration of our large refining and petrochemical platforms and of expanding our petrochemical operations from low-cost feedstock to take advantage of the fast-growing Asian polymer market.

“Furthermore, this project will enable us to strengthen our ties with Saudi Aramco, with whom we successfully operate our biggest and most efficient refinery in the world.”

The front-end engineering and design (FEED) of the project is expected to be started by Saudi Aramco and Total in the third quarter of this year.

The project will produce more than 2.7 million metric tonnes of chemicals, creating 8,000 local direct and indirect jobs.

Saudi Aramco president and CEO Amin Nasser said: “Our joint venture SATORP is a remarkably successful model of industry partnership and we are keen to build on this success to further underpin Saudi Aramco’s strategy to expand its capacity in the chemicals sector by 2030.”
