After a day that saw the hit show "Roseanne" canceled by ABC, series creator and star Roseanne Barr, who had vowed to quit Twitter, went on a tweeting spree, apologizing to the cast and crew of the show for posting the racist tweet that caused the production to be booted from the network.

In the course of her tweets on Tuesday night, Barr, 65, took blame for the show's cancelation. But she also sought to partially explain the offending tweet, about Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama. Barr partly attributed her state of mind at the time to her use of the drug Ambien.

"Guys I did something unforgiveable so do not defend me," Barr said in a now-deleted tweet. "It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting-it was memorial day too-i went 2 far & do not want it defended-it was egregious Indefensible. I made a mistake I wish I hadn't but...don't defend it please."
