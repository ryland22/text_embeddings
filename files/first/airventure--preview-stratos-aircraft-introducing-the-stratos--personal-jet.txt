Sticking to the schedule set since the first test flight in November, the Stratos 714 will make its official public debut at AirVenture 2017 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin later this month. “Fresh out of the upholstery and paint shops,” the single-engine jet will be on display all week (July 24-30) at Boeing Plaza, following a press conference, featuring CEO Michael LeMaire and Chief Sales Officer Kevin Jordan, that will take place Monday, July 24, at 9:30 a.m.

In May, the Oregon-based company announced that the 714 completed its first flight test phase, as the test pilots logged 52 hours on 33 flights. The aircraft topped out at 320 ktas and 17,000 feet, with a max test weight of 8,300 pounds. At the time, Lemaire said he and the Stratos team were “extremely pleased” with the 714’s progress, and added that there would be no major changes in design.

AirVenture will provide the public with the first look at what the 714, which is powered by a Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D-5 engine, could ultimately look like when it rolls off the production line. Still, there is plenty of testing to be done, and so as we eagerly await the 714’s big moment in Oshkosh, let’s take a look back at the jet’s progress.
