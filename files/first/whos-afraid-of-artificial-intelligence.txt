Artificial intelligence is one of the those wonky topics that tech geeks salivate over but spend little time dissecting. Its usually referenced as a simple programming tool called deep learning, which trains robots in a given task by introducing voluminous amounts of data, or as a scary, existential threat to mankind.

In our second episode of Season 3, "Who's Afraid of AI?" we explore this technology that's affecting nearly every aspect of the auto industry and beyond. Host Shiraz Ahmed interviews Maya Pindeus, the 27-year-old CEO of Humanizing Autonomy, an AI startup focused on human-machine interactions with autonomous cars. Pindeus met a Daimler executive at Ars Electronica, a conference that focuses on the nexus of arts and technology, in Austria, and later began collobarating on a project.

In the interview, Pindeus discusses how she went from architecture to AI to self-driving cars and what a transportation system that doesn't take regular people into account would look like. Listen to the full episode above.
