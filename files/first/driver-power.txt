Driver Power is the UK’s number one car customer satisfaction survey and in 2018 it was bigger and better than ever.

The 2018 Driver Power survey gave you the chance to tell us what you think of your car, car manufacturer, car dealer, car insurance company or car breakdown cover provider. It was your opportunity to give fellow motorists the benefit of your experience.

You told us the good and bad points about your car and the service you’ve received from your dealer. Driver Power collates the results and delivers its verdict on the cars and companies that provide the best and worst customer experiences in the UK today.

In the opening part of the 2018 Driver Power survey, new car owners across the UK told us what they loved and hated about the cars they bought in the last 12 months. The results give the best insight anywhere into what new car owners actually think of the cars they purchased and drive every day, helping fellow motorists choose their next vehicles and giving car makers a crucial heads-up on where they're going wrong.

We analysed the data and compiled the results to give the definitive verdict on which new cars are the UK’s best to buy, own and run. We had a host of new entries in the Driver Power 2018 new car survey as well as some shock fallers and deserving climbers. How does your car fare? What wins overall? The top 75 new cars to own are all revealed in our 2018 Driver Power results – and it’s all voted for by you.

You can also find the best cars to own by market sector and our run down of the top cars in each of the survey’s sections. So if you want to know what owners think are the best new superminis or SUVs, or find out which models rank highest for comfort or technology, you’ve come to the right place. As a car buying tool, Driver Power is hard to beat.
