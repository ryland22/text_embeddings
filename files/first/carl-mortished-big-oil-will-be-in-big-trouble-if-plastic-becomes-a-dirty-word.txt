In the old days, there was a very large enterprise called Imperial Chemical Industries, later streamlined to ICI. The company did what it said on the tin, manufacturing chemicals and some consumer products, notably Dulux paint.

It was so big that newspaper scribblers dubbed it “the bell-wether of British industry”; stockbrokers and fund managers hung their investment decisions on its every utterance. The assumption was that if ICI sneezed, the nation’s makers and movers of stuff might be due for a bout of flu.

ICI is no more; outgunned and outclassed by smarter, more efficient German, US and Far Eastern rivals. Today, the fortunes of a company that publishes an online scrapbook command a lot more international attention than the likes of BASF, Dow Chemical and Britain’s Ineos, but the chemical industry still tells us very important things about the state of the global economy.

Chemical manufacturers make stuff we all need and use, such as the plastics used to package our food, pipe water and waste, make wiring safe in our homes and fit together cars and consumer gadgets. Chemical companies make polyethylene — commonly known as polythene — the material in plastic bags and bottles that has recently become public enemy number one for ambitious politicians (almost eclipsing the great evil of climate change), but more on that later.

This industry is on a roll; enormous investments are being made in industrial plant to produce ethylene, a volatile gas that is the building block for plastics, such as polythene. In America, nine new facilities are under construction to crack ethane, a by-product of drilling for shale oil and gas, into ethylene. Each plant costs billions of dollars and the money will produce an extra 10.7 million tonnes per year of ethylene, a huge amount to add to a global market of 140 million tonnes.

The big bulk chemical companies are betting the farm on plastics. Royal Dutch Shell said recently that it would increase the capital employed in its chemicals business by 50%. India and South Africa are also investing. America, flush with its shale oil and gas bounty is seizing the baton from the Arabian Gulf which has run out of easy supplies of feedstock for ethylene crackers. Ineos is shipping ethane, pumped out of American shale wells and chilled and compressed into liquid to its cracker at Grangemouth in Scotland.

The chemical expansion is ultimately all about the developing economies, notably China, where people are consuming more food, building more houses and buying more stuff. Global demand for ethylene is expanding at a rate of 4.2% per year, says ICIS, the chemical price assessment agency.

But there are warnings; the ethylene price in the US has collapsed to levels not seen for almost two decades. Overproduction because of the shale ethane bonanza is blamed and figures from the American Chemistry Council point to a sudden dip in output in the first quarter of this year. The chemical industry has a tendency to over-invest in the upturn of the cycle, only to suffer long periods of over-supply and price slump. The question is whether the upturn in investment will kill the goose.

For the big oil companies, growth in demand for plastics is a blessing in a world which is rapidly falling out of love with petroleum products. Demand for petrol is falling in Europe. If demand for transport fuels were to peak over the next 10 to 15 years, you might wonder what big oil is going to do with all that stuff bubbling from the ground.

Making plastics is one way of keeping the hydrocarbon molecules flowing from well-head to consumer. The sunk capital in the infrastructure of the global oil industry is colossal and it needs product to sell — plastics is one way of keeping the sun rising for big oil over the next three decades.

Unless governments spoil the view. According to Nigel Davis, of ICIS, recycling will in the long run have a big effect on the plastics market. If the present hue and cry over plastic pollution in the oceans is to be tackled, it will require a vast amount of investment in recycling. You might think that would be good for the petrochemical giants. Not necessarily, says Mr Davis, recycling is more likely to be a local business. “You break the raw material supply chain that has been around for 80 years.”

The fragmentation of 100-year-old businesses that span the globe would be complex chemistry, at the very least.
