What is "A Greater Cleveland?"

"A Greater Cleveland" is a long-term project by cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer to convene a conversation that identifies barriers faced by Cleveland children in poverty and comes up with solutions that help those children lead rewarding lives.

Ultimately, it is a project about breaking the cycle of multigenerational poverty that prevents the region from thriving.

At cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer, we have a huge audience and platforms that reach millions of people each month. What we don't have is the expertise to solve the problems we identify.

That's where this project turns to you.

Greater Cleveland is home to people of great generosity and much expertise. We hope that by using our reach to convene a conversation, we will attract a great many of you to help find answers to the biggest issues vexing the region.

We have started this project with vignettes, in text, photos and video, that deal with the themes we have encountered. We hope to build empathy in our audience for the people we write about.

As the series continues, we will tackle some of the broader topics we have seen and highlight agencies and programs that show promise, on a small scale, in addressing those topics.
