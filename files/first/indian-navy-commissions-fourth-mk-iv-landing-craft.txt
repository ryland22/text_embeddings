The Indian Navy (IN) has commissioned its fourth Mk IV landing craft utility (LCU) platform built by state-owned shipyard Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE).

Named IN LCU L54 , the 62.8 m vessel entered service in a ceremony held on 25 May at Port Blair, the capital of India’s Andaman and Nicobar Islands and headquarters of the IN-headed tri-service command.

The platform, which is part of an INR21 billion (USD310 million) contract for eight LCUs signed between GRSE and the Indian government in September 2011, was launched at GRSE’s facility in Kolkata in March 2015, and now joins three other vessels of the class – L51, L52, L53 – that entered service in March 2017, August 2017, and April 2018, respectively.
