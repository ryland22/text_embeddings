Stay in the fight year-round. Download the official NRA-ILA

app today!

Thanks to all your hard work last year, the Second Amendment saw resounding victories on Election Day 2016. From local state legislature races, to governor races, to Congress and the United States presidency, YOU showed up to elected pro-gun lawmakers into office. YOU did that.

Still, this is no time to rest. For the first time in 8 years, the NRA has the chance to go on offense on the national level. We’re already begun working with lawmakers in Washington to enact pro-Second Amendment reforms and roll back Obama-era gun control regulations. On the state level, we’re working around the country to protect your Right to Keep and Bear Arms, and fight back against the Bloomberg gun control machine.

But whatever the scenario, know this: We can’t do it without your help. If you haven’t yet downloaded the official NRA-ILA app, please consider doing so today!

The app will put the power of activism right on your phone. We’ll keep you updated on what we’re doing in DC and around the country. And, we’ll provide you with easy, tangible ways you can demand accountability from your lawmakers when it comes to your gun rights.

So don’t wait; download the app today! We have a lot of work to do.
