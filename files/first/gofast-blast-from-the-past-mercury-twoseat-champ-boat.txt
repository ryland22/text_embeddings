Back in the heyday of heated tunnel-boat competition, both OMC and Mercury Marine deployed two-seat boats intended to give members of the media and special guests the chance to experience the sensation of riding in one of these wickedly quick race boats. It was a treat, on par with getting a jet-fighter ride with the Blue Angels.

This photo was recently unearthed by Mercury Racing Senior Marketing Manager Rick Mackie, who was often in charge of transporting the two-seater demo boat to race venues. This boat, a 1992 Seebold built specifically for Mercury, was used to promote the International Outboard Grand Prix from 1992 to 1997. The 18-foot boat was wood with a composite cockpit capsule. It was the first two-seater to feature five-point seat belts for both driver and passenger. The Mercury Champ race outboard put out 290 hp.
