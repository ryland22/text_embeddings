Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano has been erupting for almost a month, and it’s been pumping out more than just lava into quiet residential neighborhoods. The volcano has also been pumping out ash, toxic gas, and volcanic smog, or ‘vog.’ The vog isn't just plaguing the residents of Hawaii’s big island. It’s also causing problems for islanders across the Pacific Ocean.

The U.S. National Weather Service has released an alert for the region of Micronesia, way out in the Pacific, warning residents of the island chains of the hazards of vog. The vog has spent the last few weeks drifting west on the air currents, and now it hangs heavy over the Marshall Islands and other regions in the West Pacific. Guam, which is 4,000 miles from Hawaii, is starting to see the effects.

The NWS alert warns that “residents with respiratory health problems should minimize time spent outdoors when haze is present,” and predicts that “haze concentrations will decrease as Central Pacific winds redirect haze farther to the north and away from Micronesia” over the next few days.

However, there’s also a likely possibility that vog will continue to harass Micronesia for as long as Kilauea continues to erupt, as changing winds bring more of the substance to the islands. The NWS alert says that “additional haze events are possible in subsequent weeks,” and residents of the islands are advised to stay indoors as much as possible.
