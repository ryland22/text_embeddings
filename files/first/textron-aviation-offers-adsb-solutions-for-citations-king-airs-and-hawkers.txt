Textron Aviation recently achieved certification for an ADS-B Out solution for the Citation Mustang and is offering ADS-B retrofits for several other models at its service centers worldwide.

With the ADS-B mandate quickly approaching, Textron Aviation announced that its service centers are offering ADS-B retrofits for an expanding number of models. The manufacturer announced this week that it recently achieved certification for an ADS-B Out solution for the Cessna Citation Mustang. Earlier this year Textron Aviation issued 10 service bulletins for ADS-B equipment on various Citation, King Air and Hawker models, and it has completed more than 1,000 installations so far.

In addition to getting the installation made by a company that knows the aircraft inside and out, Textron says a great benefit of getting the ADS-B retrofit through one of its service stations around the world is that the compliance is guaranteed worldwide for its ADS-B installations. ADS-B offerings from some third-party providers only apply in the country in which the aircraft is registered.

Some areas of the world, such as Australia and other countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Rim, already require ADS-B Out equipment. Europe will require the installation in mid-2020, and the United States mandate will come into effect on January 1, 2020.
