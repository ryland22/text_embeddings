Singapore Airlines will operate the world's longest commercial flights from 11 October, with the start of its near-19 hour nonstop Singapore-Newark service.

Using A350-900ULRs configured with 161 seats, the Star Alliance carrier will initally fly thrice-weekly on the route, before growing to daily frequency on 18 October.

SIA will receive its first A350-900ULR in September, with the remaining six on order scheduled for delivery by the end of the year. All seven aircraft feature 67 business and 94 in premium economy class seats.

Plans to launch nonstop Singapore-Los Angeles services will be announced at a later date. Its Singapore-Frankfurt-New York John F. Kennedy service will continue to be in operation.

"Singapore Airlines has always taken pride in pushing the boundaries to provide the best possible travel convenience for our customers, and we are pleased to be leading the way with these new non-stop flights using the latest-technology, ultra-long-range Airbus A350-900ULR," says SIA's chief executive Goh Choon Phong.

"The flights will offer our customers the fastest way to travel between the two cities – in great comfort, together with Singapore Airlines’ legendary service - and will help boost connectivity to and through the Singapore hub."

SIA last operated nonstop services between Singapore and Newark in 2013, when it returned the Airbus A340-500s that were used at that time to the manufacturer.
