EdgeWater Power Boats uses Single Piece Infusion, SPI, to ensure the exact placement of every fiberglass component which results in stronger, safer boats. Yet, it’s much more than a boatbuilding company.

The SPI process might look like a Frankenboat project, but it helps EdgeWater produce lighter boats that don't sacrifice strength.

Behind every model produced there’s a group of men and women that are highly trained in the fine art of craftsmanship. Each one is capable of filling multiple roles that are key to the build process. Their attention to detail shines through in the fit and finish of every EdgeWater boat that’s built.

SPI is just the beginning. Finishing, rigging and final assembly await.

A peek inside what makes an EdgeWater so strong.

That expert craftsmanship and SPI come together at EdgeWater Power Boats to create quality boats that employees, and future owners, can be proud of.
