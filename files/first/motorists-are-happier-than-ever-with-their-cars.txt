Car owners are happier with their cars than ever before, according to the latest Driver Power survey results.

This year's top car, the Lexus IS Mk3, surpassed last year's winning result by one per cent. It managed a satisfaction rating of 93.96 per cent compared to the Skoda Yeti in 2014, which scored 92.78 per cent.

In fact, motorists are so happy with their cars that the top five cars from the 2015 survey would have managed to top the chart in the previous year's survey.

It's not just the overall model scores that have increase over the past year, though. The top scoring car for build quality in the 2015 survey (the Lexus NX) got a satisfaction rating of 98.71 per cent - that's a 2 per cent rise on last year's winner in that category.

It's a similar story in the practicality and ease of driving categories, where this year's winners managed a one per cent improvement on the previous year's winners.

Look at the bottom-ranked models in these categories, however, and even the least satisfied owners have marked their cars highly - and that's even with an extra 50 places added in this year's survey.

For instance, the lowest rating for in-car tech in 2014 was the Toyota Corolla Mk9, which scored 70.50 per cent and placed 150th. This year the BMW 1 Series comes bottom in this category in 200th place, but managed to score 73.33 per cent.
