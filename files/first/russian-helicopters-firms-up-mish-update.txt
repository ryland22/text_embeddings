The Ulan-Ude Aircraft Plant (U-UAZ), a subsidiary of Rostec’s Russian Helicopters, has finalised the development of an updated Mil Mi-171Sh medium helicopter – unveiled as the Mi-171Sh-VN prototype at the 2017 MAKS Airshow in Russia – and plans to actively market it internationally in 2019.

Jane’s understands that the company has incorporated user feedback from Russian special operations forces that operated the prototype in Syria since its public unveiling, to incorporate further refinements to the Mi-171Sh platform.

"In 2017 we presented the upgraded Mi-171Sh-VN prototype at the MAKS airshow, and over 70 foreign delegations visited the static display,” Russian Helicopters CEO Andrey Boginsky told Jane's .
