With a rainy day in Cleveland, a baseball game between the Indians and the Toronto Blue Jays was forced to take a backseat to America's other, newer past time: Battle royale video games.

Someone who works for the Indians decided to use the rainy off time to play Fortnite on the scoreboard.

The Indians scoreboard was upgraded in 2015, meaning that whoever was playing the popular game was taking out enemies with 13,000 square feet of high-definition screen space.

The Indians declined to identify who, exactly, was playing the game, using only the royal "We" to refer to the player.

The Indians aren't the first team to take advantage of their large screen to get larger-than-life video games. In 2014, the Washington Wizards were using their screen to play FIFA.
