A decade after it entered the business aviation market with the launch of the Kodiak 100, Quest Aircraft has introduced the second-generation version of the single-engined turboprop to boost the aircraft’s appeal in this increasingly crowded sector.

Deliveries are already under way.

The Series II features a host of new features and equipment including Garmin’s next generation G1000NXi flightdeck, additional storage in the cockpit, a restyled cargo doorstep to “reduce weight and improve functionality”, and improved fuselage seals to provide “even better” soundproofing and cabin ventilation.

Quest, which is owned by Japan’s Setouchi Holdings, has also added a single-point refuelling station to give the operator what it calls “a simple, clean and easy way to refuel both wing tanks, using a single port”.

Since its introduction in 2008 the Sandpoint, Idaho-based airframer has incorporated over 200 enhancements into the short take-off-and-landing Kodiak, including the introduction of two new interiors, an increased landing weight, and the integration of the Garmin GFC 700 automatic flight control system.

The 10-seat, Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-34 powered aircraft is vying for sales against a host of other turbine-single competitors including the Daher TBM 910/930, Pilatus PC-12NG, Piper M500/600, Textron Aviation’s Cessna Caravan family and its in-development Denali.

Flight Fleets Analyzer records a global fleet of more than 250 of the all-metal aircraft. The company shipped 31 examples in 2017.
