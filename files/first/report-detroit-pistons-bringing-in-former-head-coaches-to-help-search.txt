The Detroit Pistons are reportedly bringing in two former NBA head coaches to assist their search to replace Stan Van Gundy.

ESPN.com’s Adrian Wojnarowski is reporting Bernie Bickerstaff and Jim Lynam will consult with the Pistons on their coaching search.

Coaching consultants will arrive next week to observe candidates brought to the practice facility in Auburn Hills, a source told the Free Press on Wednesday.

Candidates will be asked about coaching philosophies and could be instructed to conduct hypothetical practices.

They will be asked to map out what the first practice will look like.

The consultants would then make observations to the team leading the search – senior adviser Ed Stefanski, Pistons vice chairman Arn Tellem and Pistons ownership representative Bob Wentworth.

The Pistons are seeking a new coach after owner Tom Gores fired Van Gundy earlier this month after four seasons.

Bickerstaff, 74, was last a head coach for the Charlotte franchise in 2007.

Lynam, 76, was last a head coach for the Washington Wizards in 1997.
