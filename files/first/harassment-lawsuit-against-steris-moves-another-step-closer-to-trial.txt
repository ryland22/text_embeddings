MENTOR, Ohio -- A Lake County judge filed an opinion late Tuesday ruling that there is enough evidence to move forward with a trial for a sexual harassment lawsuit against Steris Corp.

Lake County Common Pleas Court judge Vincent A. Culotta said in the 12-page ruling that a trial is scheduled for an unknown date in September. Former employee Jacquelyn Adams says in her lawsuit that she was subjected to a "hostile work environment" while employed as a trainer at Steris for about five years.

The lawsuit was filed against the Mentor-based global healthcare company in March 2017 with claims that Adams was sexually harassed for years by various male employees, despite complaining to her supervisor. Adams also said she filed complaints with Steris' human resources manager, but they were not addressed to her satisfaction.

Steris could not immediately be reached for comment.

"The Adams opinion is an important decision in the evolving legal literature of #metoo," Adams' attorney Avery Friedman said referring to an international movement against sexual harassment and assault.

Adams began working at Steris in February 2011. Her lawsuit claims that various negative gender comments and conduct were directed toward her starting soon after her first day. Such comments included "a joke" made about rape, being called a stripper, being called derogatory names and statements from male employees looking at pictures of nude women online.

According to the lawsuit, Adams received a "shocking response from defendant Steris Corporation's human resources manager to the effect that 'boys will be boys.'"

Steris' written response in the lawsuit states that Adams, during her exit interview, never "expressed that she was resigning due to sexism or gender bias" and that she failed to show evidence indicating the work environment adversely affected her ability to perform her job duties.

Adams is seeking compensation for past and future pain and suffering losses exceeding $75,000.
