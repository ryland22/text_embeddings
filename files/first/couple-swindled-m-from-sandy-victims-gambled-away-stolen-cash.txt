A New Jersey couple admitted to stealing more than $1.4 million from Hurricane Sandy victims and spending the cash in Atlantic City casinos and on luxury items, according to a report.

Jeffrey Colmyer, 42, and Tiffany Cimino, 34, of Little Egg Harbor in Ocean County, targeted more than 20 hurricane victims in a fraud scheme through Rayne Construction Management Services and Colmyer & Sons, NJ.com reported.

The victims paid for reconstruction, home elevations or repairs that were not started or completed. Some of the money came from government relief programs.

Colmyer used the stolen cash to gamble hundreds of thousands of dollars at seven Atlantic City casinos, authorities said. The couple also bought a $17,000 diamond ring.

“Colmyer and Cimino heartlessly preyed on Sandy victims whose homes had been destroyed, stealing the relief funds that were the lifeline these victims needed to rebuild in the aftermath of the historic storm,” state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said in a statement.

“By sending Colmyer to prison, we deliver a strong deterrent message that anyone willing to sink so low as to steal disaster relief money from victims will face a stern reckoning.”

Colmyer and Cimino both admitted to theft charges.

Colmyer, who also pleaded guilty to money laundering, is expected to be sentenced in September to seven years in state prison, while the plea deal calls for Cimino to get probation.

The deal also calls for them to pay $1.45 million in restitution. Colmyer also owes $56,472 in back taxes.
