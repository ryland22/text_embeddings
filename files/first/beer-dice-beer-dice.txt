The dice are made primarily of crushed up hops, with a coating of crystal resin to keep them from falling apart and inlaid with brass so they have actual numbers. While these dice are obviously very cool, they are also ludicrously expensive. At minimum, you can shell out $53 for a single d20, or upgrade to the full set of seven standard polyhedral dice for $283. For context, a set of normal acrylic dice will only run you about six bucks, metal sets can be found for as low as $15, and of course you can just buya pound of rando dice (with at least 15 full sets guaranteed) for a mere $20.

Maybe you're better off just having a beer.
