GE Appliances is the first to announce voice-enabled air conditioners, which will be available at Home Depot and Lowe's. Voice integration means you can now turn these units on and off or adjust the temperature without leaving your couch or even picking up your phone. These are the first air conditioners to work with Apple HomeKit, which can coordinate these appliances with other smart home devices in your home.

Of course, these air conditioners can also be controlled via the GE Appliances app on your phone, which allows you to monitor them when you are away from home. No more worrying about whether or not you left the A/C on when you left the house. The new air conditioners include model numbers AEC08LX, AEC10AX, AEC12AX, AHP08LX, and AHP10LX, and range in price from $229 to $329.
