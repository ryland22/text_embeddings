Michigan State football has to wait more than three months before it can begin its quest for a Big Ten championship — and perhaps beyond.

That does not mean we can’t look ahead.

The Spartans’ seven-home/five-away schedule is favorable for the most part, with a daunting early September trip to the desert heat at Arizona State and a game at Penn State that could well decide the Big Ten East Division champion. MSU also welcomes both Michigan and Ohio State to Spartan Stadium and avoids West Division-favorite Wisconsin again.

Oct. 13: At Penn State Nittany Lions

Where: Beaver Stadium, University Park, Pennsylvania.

Last year’s record: 11-2, 7-2 Big Ten.

Postseason: Defeated Washington 35-28 in Fiesta Bowl.

Head coach: James Franklin, fifth season.

Players to watch: QB Trace McSorley, WR Juwan Johnson, CB Amani Oruwariye

About the opponent: Penn State loses three significant weapons in RB Saquon Barkley, TE Mike Giesicki and WR DaeSean Hamilton. However, second-team All-Big Ten pick Trace McSorley is one of eight returnees on offense, which includes four of his five linemen. Finding new receivers to flank Juwan Johnson, who had 701 yards and one TD among his 54 catches, will be critical for McSorley to replicate last year’s success. The Nittany Lions also lose eight starters on defense from a team that was upset 27-24 at MSU last season on a field goal as time expired.

Prediction: Penn State 28, MSU 24.
