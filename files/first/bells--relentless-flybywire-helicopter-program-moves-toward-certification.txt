Bell’s 525 Relentless Fly-by-wire Helicopter Program Moves Toward Certification

Since the 525 Relentless returned to the air in July 2017 after the fatal crash of flight test vehicle 1 a year before, Bell has flown both of its remaining super-medium twins, FTV2 and 3, nearly an additional 200 flight-test hours. The two aircraft have accumulated approximately 290 hours in total between them. FTV4 is scheduled to make its maiden flight in the fourth quarter.

At the Heli-Expo show in Las Vegas, Bell showed its 525 mockup with a full VIP interior, complete with Bristow Helicopters livery, even though the oil-and-gas and search-and-rescue operator hasn’t been officially revealed as a customer, as have any other customers. The company hasn’t set a formal price for the 525, but it expects to complete certification flight testing by the end of 2018.
