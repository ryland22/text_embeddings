Well it looks like the new "Roseanne" show, ABC's expected hit, turned out to be a hack, or at least its star did.

The network canceled the show Tuesday after Roseanne Barr tweeted a racist comment about former Obama administration aide Valerie Jarrett.

According to late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel, Barr's comment should have offended anyone with a brain. But the potential loss of funds for the network has the comic, whose show also appears on ABC, worried. His plan? Take a look at Best of Late Night, above, for the creative way he drops the star, but keeps the show going.

And comic Jordan Klepper says the show isn't going away. He's waiting for it to appear on the MAGA version of Hulu.
