“The Gospel According to André” follows the gregarious, larger-than-life editor, stylist and fashion icon André Leon Talley. Yet unlike previous glossy docs such as “The September Issue,” “Gospel” is far more than a dressed-up Vogue infomercial.

Fashion fans may know Talley as Vogue editrix Anna Wintour’s perennially caftan-clad sidekick. And “Gospel” showcases the 68-year-old’s trademark zest and wit, as well as his everyman quality.

(His scenes with his childhood friend — a working-class Southerner who prefers baseball and hot dogs to couture and caviar — are some of the best.)

But director Kate Novack pushes Talley to speak about his experiences as a black, gay man. He recalls how white students at Duke, where his grandmother was a housekeeper, threw rocks at him, and how his mother was embarrassed by his outré church outfits. Later, one Yves Saint Laurent employee would call him “Queen Kong.” It may not be the prettiest fashion documentary, but “Gospel” is certainly the most real — and, due to Talley’s trailblazing, inspiring.
