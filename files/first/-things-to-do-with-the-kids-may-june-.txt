Jeff Reiter / Cantigny Park

This year, Memorial Day comes with special resonance for this west-suburban park: It’s also the centennial of the World War I battle when the U.S. Army’s First Division liberated the tiny French village of Cantigny. Fast forward 100 years, and the First Division Museum inside Cantigny Park hosts a daylong event, including a wreath-laying ceremony at 10 a.m., a display of military vehicles, and WWI-themed family activities beginning at 11 a.m. Over at the park’s bandshell, more than two dozen members of the Illinois Brass Band perform at 3 p.m. Cantigny Park, 1S151 Winfield Road, Wheaton. Free for museum admission and concert; $10 for parking. https://tinyurl.com/ya6fzmyr
