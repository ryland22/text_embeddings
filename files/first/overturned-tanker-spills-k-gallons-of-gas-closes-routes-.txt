An tanker truck spilled 9,000 gallons of gasoline after it overturned and ruptured on Routes 1&9 in Linden on Wednesday morning, forcing the closure of the road in both directions, officials said.

Route 1&9 is closed and detoured between Wood Avenue and Pleasant Street, police said.

Cleanup is expected to continue through the evening rush and last until at least Thursday morning, police said.

As of noon, the Crown Inn was being evacuated and Linden firefighters were going door-to-door to measure air quality levels. Additional evacuations could be necessary.

The tanker truck was headed north on South Stiles Street at around 8:30 a.m. when it overturned while making a turn onto southbound Route 1, police said. The driver was treated for a minor injury at the scene, police said.

Traffic is backed up in both directions prior to where vehicles are being detoured through side streets. The crash is near Linden Airport.

Union County hazmat officials are coordinating the cleanup.

In addition, Wheeler Park is closed to pedestrians.

"1/9 will remain closed throughout the day so that our emergency personnel can clean up. The odor is strong down here... and the traffic is horrific on stiles/ Wood Avenue and Linden Avenue....So if you live in the area plan accordingly.
