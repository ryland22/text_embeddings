The deal will see Farnborough being granted Official Airshow Partner status by FlightGlobal, while FlightGlobal has become an Official Media Partner of the Airshow.

The renewed relationship will see FlightGlobal produce four editions of Flight Daily News, covering all the biggest stories and analysis from the show and distributed by FlightGlobal’s familiar red-suited distribution team.
