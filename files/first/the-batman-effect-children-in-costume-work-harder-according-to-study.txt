Far from being a distraction, it turns out dressing kids as their favorite superhero or cartoon character gets them to work harder, according to a report from a recent issue of Child Development.

Yes, scientists really had young children dress up as Batman, Bob the Builder, Dora the Explorer and more and then checked to see if they worked harder than their unadorned peers. What’s even more amazing is that the costumed children actually did persevere longer than the other kids.

There were 180 children in the study, with one group in costume, one that referred to themselves in the third person and one that referred to themselves in the first person. The children, aged four and six, were asked to do a “repetitive task” for 10 minutes. They were told the task was important, but they were also told that they had the option to take breaks with “an extremely attractive video game.”

Perhaps not surprisingly, the six-year-olds stuck to the task longer than the four-year-olds. More eye raising was this result: “Across both ages, children who impersonated an exemplar other—in this case a character, such as Batman—spent the most time working.”

Children who referred to themselves in the third person followed, with children who referred to themselves in the first person spending the most amount of time on the iPad and the least amount of time working on the given task.

Study authors Rachel White and Emily Prager theorized that the costumes allowed the children to “self-distance,” or look at their own situation as an outsider, which helped to improve their performance. “Taking a mental step back from one’s own situation could help children persevere in the face of distraction,” according to the report.
