Walhalla, South Carolina-based Just Aircraft, makers of the SuperSTOL extreme short field performer, is developing an Ultralight for the Part 103 market. Named Just 103, the single-seat Ultralight is expected to be available as a kit or a complete aircraft later this year.

The flying prototype of the open fuselage Just 103 is a high-wing design constructed of steel tubes and an aluminum tail boom. But Troy Woodland, who also designed the SuperSTOL, is reworking the tail to incorporate a steel truss. Other than a small windscreen, the cockpit is completely open leaving the pilot to fully enjoy the sights and scents of the flying environment.

The Just 103 is powered by an Italian engine, the 37-horsepower Polini Thor 250. There are also plans to power the 103 with a Rotax 582 engine, but with that configuration it would no longer qualify under the Ultralight rules, which limit the aircraft to 254 pounds and 55 knots. Instead, the Rotax-powered version would be introduced as a Light Sport Aircraft. Unlike the LSA standards, Part 103 requires no pilot certificate, age limits or medical requirements.
