A burglary early Sunday morning ended up with a shot fired by the homeowner, Charleston Police say.

It happened in the 700 block of Ivy Drive.

Eli Wayne Freeland, 30, was arrested and charged with one count of nighttime burglary.

Police say the homeowner fired one shot, which hit the living room floor. No charges were filed against him because police say he was acting in self-defense.

The homeowner told police that Freeland said someone was after him and was going to kill him. The homeowner warned him to stay behind a couch or he would be shot. That's when the homeowner said Freeland advanced toward him, leading him to fire the shot.

Police say Freeland had a Maryland driver’s license but had been staying at a men’s shelter for the homeless in Charleston.

He was taken to a hospital and treated for minor injuries before being transferred to the South Central Regional Jail.

His bond is $25,000.
