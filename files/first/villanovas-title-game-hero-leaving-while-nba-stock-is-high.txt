Villanova’s NCAA Tournament hero is going out on top.

Donte DiVincenzo announced Tuesday that he will sign with an agent and stay in the NBA Draft, where he is projected to be a mid-to-late first-round pick next month.

“I thank everyone who has helped me reach this decision because it was not easy,” the 6-foot-5 guard wrote in an Instagram post announcing the move ahead of Wednesday’s deadline. “I strive to get better as a person and a player everyday, everything that Villanova has instilled in me will allow me to reach all goals I have in mind.”

DiVincenzo, a redshirt sophomore, shot up draft boards as he led the Wildcats to the NCAA championship. He scored 31 points in the national title game against Michigan and was named the Final Four Most Outstanding Player.

The 2017-18 Big East Sixth Man of the Year averaged 13.4 points and 4.8 rebounds per game. He then impressed at the NBA Combine and in individual workouts with teams, enough to forego his final two years at Villanova and begin his pro career.

“Proud of our guy Donte – we have great confidence in him at the next level !!” Villanova coach Jay Wright tweeted.
