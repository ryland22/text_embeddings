Bombardier marked the rebranding and expansion of its Global family at EBACE 2018 with a letter of intent (LOI) from Hong Kong’s HK Bellawings Jet for the sale of up to 18 ultra-long-range Global 6500s and 7500s worth a total of $1.136 billion at list prices. The LOI, announced late Tuesday, represents a firm order for eight (four each for the 6500 and 7500) and 10 options (six 6500s and four 7500s). No details on delivery schedules were announced. The renamed Global 7500 (née 7000) will enter service later this year, and the new Global 6500 is expected to enter service in 2019.

"We're thrilled with the tremendous response we have received since launching our newest Global aircraft just days ago," said Peter Likoray, senior vice president of worldwide sales and marketing for Bombardier Business Aircraft (Booth Z125, SD22). "Our leading Global aircraft will contribute to the continued success of HK Bellawings Jet and its operations in the region."

According to HK Bellawings president Zhang Yijia, “The two models align with HK Bellawings' rapid development to be a one-stop business aviation solution, empowering us to reach higher and further in the long run."

With a range of 6,600 nm, the Global 6500 can connect Hong Kong or Singapore with London. The 7,700 nm range of the Global 7500 can link Hong Kong to New York, and Singapore to San Francisco. The 6500 and 7500 are priced at $56 million and $72 million, respectively.
