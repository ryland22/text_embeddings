Knicks icon Mark Jackson — in his first public comments since being passed over for the head-coaching position at the Garden — took the high road when asked about being spurned by his former team.

Jackson, who played six-plus seasons for the Knicks (1987-92, 2001-02), is still a fan favorite at the Garden and was the popular choice of many to succeed Jeff Hornacek as coach. But when Jackson, now an ESPN analyst, was asked on Tuesday about losing out to David Fizdale, he was diplomatic and thanked the Knicks, including team president Steve Mills and general manager Scott Perry, for considering him.

“Nah, The only thing for me, they have an outstanding coach in Fizdale, quality guys, class guys running it in Steve and Scott, and I wish them nothing but the very best,” Jackson said on an ABC conference call concerning NBA Finals coverage. “It was a heck of an opportunity, and I wish them nothing but the very best.”

Jackson is a Bishop Loughlin grad and St. John’s product who was named NBA Rookie of the Year in 1988.

Jackson, who coached the Warriors from 2011-14, was one of 11 candidates to interview for the Knicks’ job, and seemed to be a popular pick among fans. After the gig went to Fizdale, Jackson went back to prepping to broadcast the Finals alongside former Knicks head coach Jeff Van Gundy. Jackson demurred when pressed to expound on the Knicks situation.

“No, I just expounded. I’m not trying to be a jerk. That does nothing,” Jackson said. “That does nothing, with all due respect.”
