Serena Williams’ catsuit at Tuesday’s French Open match was surely a winner.

“Catsuit anyone?” she quipped on Twitter with a photo of her slimming black ensemble by Nike that also featured a red band around the waist. “For all the moms out there who had a tough recovery from pregnancy – here you go. If I can do it, so can you. Love you all!!”

Williams’ win against Kristyna Pliskova was her first Grand Slam victory since giving birth last fall. She beat Pliskova in straight sets.

The 36-year-old tennis champ, who is after her 24th Grand Slam title, will take on Ashleigh Barty in the next round.

The new mom has always made headlines with her fashion choices. She most recently wore sneakers to the royal wedding reception.

Williams’ fashion line, Serena, debuted Wednesday on her website with 12 core pieces. Prices range from $35 to $250.
