A sinkhole has appeared on the White House's North Lawn -- which has naturally spawned jokes on the internet.

The sinkhole, confirmed by groundskeepers, is just outside the office of White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley. The sinkhole, which groundskeepers remarked was smaller than they thought it might be, was roped off with cones and caution tape.

But, according to reporters who have observed it, it appears to be growing.

On Twitter, the hole's appearance garnered jokes about the president's "drain the swamp" slogan and that the sinkhole was actually a portal to another dimension.

It's not like a growing sinkhole right outside the press briefing room at the White House has any existential meaning to it at all, right? — Jeff Urbanchuk (@jurbanchuk) May 22, 2018

Others joked about how close the hole is to the press briefing room.

How appropriate is it that the sinkhole is opening near the press briefing room?https://t.co/NRJVKuzcR1 — G (@Random_acct) May 22, 2018

The White House covered up the hole later in the afternoon.
