For over a decade, the Roman Catholic Church has been offering an exorcism course, where attendees learn step-by-step approaches to recognize the devil, distinguish possession from mental illness, and cast away demons. This year's course suggested that future exorcisms might even get delivered over the phone.

According to Reuters, the 89-year-old Cardinal Ernest Simoni of Albania described reciting Latin prayers of exorcism over the phone, much like performing the rite in person. "They call me and we speak and that’s how I do it,” Simoni explained.

Catholic Church officials says the numbers of demonic possessions are on the rise, as are the requests for exorcisms. Some 200 people attended this year's course, both lay Catholics and priests. Attendees of the week-long course, which takes place in a Catholic education institute in Rome, will walk away with a certificate of completion. The certificate doesn't entitle them to cast out demons, per say: that rite is reserved for priests, with a license of their bishop's permission. But lay Catholics can become "auxiliary exorcists," giving moral support to the priest casting out the demon.

Simoni emphasizes that exorcisms should only be attempted after a visit to a physician. “Discernment is important,” he said.

This isn't the first time technology has been used to update this ancient (and questionable) ritual. Last year, the Catholic Church sanctioned the first English translation of the church's Latin rituals for exorcism. “Given that there’s less facility in Latin than there used to be, even among priests, it opens the door to more priests to do this.” Father Andrew Menke told Catholic News Service. Not only does the translation allow more priests to carry out rituals, but hearing English versions of the rite might console the possessed.
