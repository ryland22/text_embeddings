It’s time to pick a winner of the 2018 Auto Express Design Award and we need your help.

Here at Auto Express we put on our steel rimmed spectacles and black polo neck jumpers to evaluate all the latest car designs from the past 12 months. We then came up with a shortlist of the best, but it is now over to you to vote for a winner. The car which collects the most votes will then be crowned as having the best new car design of 2018.

The automotive industry has produced some outstanding designs over the past 12 months, with both concept and production cars dispelling the myth all new cars look the same. Not only are these new cars beautiful works of automotive art, but they quite often reveal secrets of how the next generation of cars will look from a particular marque, or even hark back to famous models from its past.

So, without further ado, in no particular order, here’s our pick of the best car designs of the last 12 months. You can familiarise yourself with the car designs by checking out our gallery or clicking the links below, then just register your vote in our poll....
