The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that Salmonella bacteria causes about 1.2 million illnesses, 23,000 hospitalizations and 450 deaths in the U.S. annually.

People infected with Salmonella can develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps between 12 and 72 hours after infection, according to the CDC. Most people recover in a few days without treatment.
