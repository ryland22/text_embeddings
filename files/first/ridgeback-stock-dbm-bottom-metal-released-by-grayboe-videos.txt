Glendale, Arizona-based Grayboe last week announced the full release of their Ridgeback stock line and their new DBM bottom metal.

The solid fiberglass epoxy Grayboe Ridgeback features an adjustable cheek piece, built-in bubble level, vertical pistol grip, and a spacer system to allow the user to adjust the length of pull. Best yet, it includes M-Lok slots in the fore-end to add accessories. Grayboe uses a proprietary compound to create a low-void stock that maintains dimensional stability and strength in the harshest of conditions.

It is available in Remington 700 Short Action & Long Action, DBM or BDL, and for a variety of Sendero/Varmint barrel contours including those from Lilja, Shilen, Rock Creek and others. MSRP is $599.

Grayboe Bottom Metal

All new from Grayboe is their DBM Bottom Metal, which is compatible with any M5 inlet stock and will accept just about any AICS magazine on the market. Machined from 6061 aluminum billet, it hits the scales at 3.25-ounces and includes a machined steel mag release. Retail is $159.
