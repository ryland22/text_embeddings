The investigation will look closely at why the chartered tour helicopter flipped over as soon as it hit the water.

During initial interviews with NTSB officials, the pilot of the Airbus AS350B2 that crashed into New York’s East River on March 11 was unable to recall how many photographic flights he had conducted on the day of the accident. He could only remember that his duty day began about 11 a.m. local time and that the accident occurred about 1908 local time, slightly more than eight hours later.

Following the helicopter’s impact with the water, the AS350 quickly rolled inverted. While the pilot escaped, none of the five passengers aboard survived. Still strapped into their seats, all five people drowned. In addition to the standard seatbelts installed on the helicopter, passengers were also restrained with an additional harness provided by the charter tour operator designed to keep them from falling as they maneuvered in their seats to take photos.

The pilot’s emergency briefing instructed passengers to use a knife, apparently attached to their life vests, to cut themselves free in an emergency. In the confusion of the crash and the upset, none of the passengers, even one who was a young firefighter, were able to do so.

The pilot remembered the helicopter flying northbound along the East River at approximately 2,000 feet when “the front seat passenger turned sideways, slid across the double bench seat toward the pilot, leaned back and extended his feet to take a photograph of his feet outside the helicopter.” The pilot recalled initiating a right turn to head back south but noticed the nose of the helicopter began to turn right faster than he expected. Hearing the low rotor rpm alert in his headset, the pilot also saw the engine pressure and fuel pressure warning lights come on, making him think the engine had failed.
