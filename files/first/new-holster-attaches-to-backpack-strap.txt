There are a lot of holster options out there, from IWB to OTB and everything in between. Now, there’s one more. Introducing the ShapeShift Backpack holster from Alien Gear.

Designed to offer the same accessibility to those in the outdoors that an Alaska-style chest holster does, the new holster includes a special mount that allows it to be securely attached to pretty much any backpack strap, but works best with those measuring 2 to 3.25 inches in width.

Once the mount is attached, the actual holster can be rotated for a full 360-degree cant so it can be custom fit to a users needs and gear.

“Well, it’s not a typical everyday carry set up, that’s for sure, but the ShapeShift Backpack Holster provides something all gun owners seek: freedom to carry when and how they want,” Alien Gear said in a statement.
