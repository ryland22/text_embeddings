Engineering, procurement and construction company CB&I has secured a contract to provide ethylene technology for two Lianyungang Petrochemical’s plants in China.

Located at Lianyungang’s petrochemical facility in Jiangsu Province, the ethylene plants have a capacity of 1,250 kilo tonnes per annum (kta) each.

Lianyungang Petrochemical is a subsidiary of Zhejiang Satellite Petrochemical.



Under the contract, CB&I’s scope of work will include a process design package, heater engineering, as well as technology license for both the plants.

The design will make use of CB&I’s low-cost ethane cracker flowsheet that is set to eliminate plant equipment and minimise investment costs.

CB&I Technology executive vice-president Daniel McCarthy said: “CB&I is already a leading technology provider for the Chinese petrochemical industry.

“It puts CB&I in a better position to win future awards in the market.”

“Being the first company to licence a unit in this new wave of ethane-only cracker projects in China not only enhances our business in the region, it puts CB&I in a better position to win future awards in the market.”

Upon completion, the two plants will be able to crack 100% ethane feed. At present, all large ethylene plants in the country crack mixed feeds or liquid feeds.

Earlier this month, CB&I won a contract from Jinneng Science & Technology for the licence and engineering design of a propane dehydrogenation (PDH) unit in Qingdao, Shandong Province.

Using CB&I’s CATOFIN technology, the PDH unit will produce 900,000mt of propylene annually.

It will also use CATOFIN catalyst and heat generating material from Clariant, the company’s catalyst partner.

CB&I provides technology and infrastructure for the energy industry.
