Place a dial indicator at the taper and rotate the shaft, looking for no more than two-thousandths of wobble.

You know you never hit bottom, but suddenly hatch hinges clatter while underway, and a tingle starts in your feet and travels all the way through your spine. Jeff Fay, owner of Fay’s Boat Yard on New Hampshire’s Lake Winnipesaukee explains how to track down inboard engine vibrations so they don’t rattle your soul.

First, don’t overlook the prop. A floating four-by-four can knock a blade out of pitch without visible signs. Check the shaft too. “If the tip of a propeller blade is bent over, there is a good chance the shaft is bent,” Fay says. Place a dial indicator at the taper and rotate the shaft, looking for no more than two-thousandths of wobble. Check long shafts in the middle too for no more than five-thousandths variance.

TIP: When checking the alignment of the shaft couplings it's best that the boat be floating in the water. A shaft aligned when the boat is on the trailer may no longer be aligned when the boat is floating in the water

Struts don’t become misaligned without a hard grounding, but cutlass bearings can wear out if a wad of fishing line or a lobster trap’s warp works between the shaft and the rubber bearing. Push the shaft around — any wiggle inside the bearing might cause vibration.
