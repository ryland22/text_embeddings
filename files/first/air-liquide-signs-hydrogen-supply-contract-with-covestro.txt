Air Liquide has signed a contract to supply hydrogen at polymer materials supplier Covestro’s production site in the port area of Antwerp, Belgium.

Under the contract, Air Liquide will invest €80m to design, build and operate a ‘next-generation’ hydrogen production unit, SMR-X.

The unit will be equipped with the company’s new technology that produces hydrogen without co-producing excess steam, improves energy efficiency and the overall environmental footprint of the production process.



Covestro Antwerp managing director Volker Weintritt said: “We are pleased to strengthen our partnership with Air Liquide.

“Thanks to this new investment, not only will a reliable and flexible supply of raw materials to our site be guaranteed, but also the new facility and its capacities could open up new perspectives for our Antwerp site.”

“The new facility and its capacities could open up new perspectives for our Antwerp site.”

Covestro will capture a portion of the CO 2 generated during the production process and use it as a feedstock in its production process.

With the hydrogen produced at the unit, Air Liquide will be able to supply customers in this industrial basin in Europe.

In connection with the latest contract, the hydrogen will be used to produce the base chemical aniline.

The new SMR-X unit is expected to start operation in 2020 and will offer optimal performances in terms of energy efficiency and safety.

Supporting development of the Covestro production site in Benelux, the plant will also bolster Air Liquide’s existing network for hydrogen supply in the Antwerp industrial area.

Air Liquide was founded in Belgium in 1906 and in the Netherlands in 1913. It currently operates 27 industrial sites throughout the Benelux.
