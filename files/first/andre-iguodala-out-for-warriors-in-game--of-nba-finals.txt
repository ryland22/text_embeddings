OAKLAND, Calif. -- Warriors forward Andre Iguodala was ruled out for Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Cavs because of a sore left knee that forced him to miss the last four games of the Western finals.

In a news release, the Warriors said Iguodala, who was the 2015 Finals MVP against the Cavs, is suffering from a bone bruise and is "making progress," but "the pain that accompanies the bone bruise persists, as does inflammation of the nerve surrounding his left knee."

The Warriors used Kevon Looney in Iguodala's place in the starting lineup against the Rockets. Iguodala is averaging 7.9 points and 4.9 rebounds during the postseason.

On the Cavs' side, Kevin Love remains in the league's concussion protocol and will not be available to reporters on Finals Media Day, which is today at Oracle Arena.
