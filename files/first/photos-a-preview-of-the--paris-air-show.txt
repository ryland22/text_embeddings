The 2017 International Paris Air Show kicked off in style on Monday, as French President Emmanuel Macron flew in aboard Airbus’ A400M military transporter. His arrival was followed by the always-exciting Patrouille de France aerial display team, as well as Airbus’ massive A380. It was a necessary spectacle for Airbus, which is using the event to showcase the incredible A380plus, featuring up to 80 more seats, while reducing fuel burn by four percent. The A380plus is expected to arrive by 2020.

But the Paris Air Show is hardly just about what Airbus is offering, or even what Boeing is unveiling as the competition. So many airplanes, helicopters, VTOL and even flying cars will be on display in Paris through the show’s finale on June 25, and we’ll be keeping track as best we can. To get things rolling, let’s take a look at some of the aircraft that have already made appearances.
