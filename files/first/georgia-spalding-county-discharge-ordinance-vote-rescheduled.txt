On May 7th, the Spalding County Board of Commissioners will be voting on 2018-ORD-07, after having tabled it during their April 16th meeting. This proposed ordinance would severely restrict the discharge of firearms on private property in the county. Please contact the county Commissioners and urge them to OPPOSE 2018-ORD-07. Click the “Take Action” button below to contact your county Commissioner.

The Board of Commissioners previously heard 2018-ORD-07 for first reading on April 2nd and tabled it for the April 16th meeting. It would be a blanket prohibition on the discharge of firearms without the consent of the owner within 300 feet of any residence or 150 feet of any property line. It would attempt to impose a one-size-fits-all solution without taking into consideration the direction of discharge or the use of certain noise reduction measures. This ordinance would severely impact recreational shooting and hunting opportunities in the county.

Again, please click “Take Action” above to contact the county Commissioners and urge them to OPPOSE 2018-ORD-07. In addition, Second Amendment and hunting heritage supporters are invited to attend the meeting to express opposition to this proposed ordinance. Information may be found here and below.
