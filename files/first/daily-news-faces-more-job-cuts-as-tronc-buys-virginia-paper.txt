Tronc on Tuesday said it was buying The Virginian-Pilot and related we sites and real estate from Landmark Media Enterprises for $34 million.

The deal includes several niche publications, plus a 465,000-square-foot headquarters in Norfolk and a Virginia Beach distribution facility.

Meanwhile, there was a new round of cuts at the Daily News over the past two weeks, and its gossip column appears to have vanished from print in recent days.

Also, two staffers from the sports desk tweeted their goodbyes on May 18.

Tom Biersdorfer wrote, “Friday was my last day at the New York Daily News after almost 8 years … I’ll miss creating the back page, after making more than 1,000 of them. Tough choice, but time for something new. -30-”

Ian Powers also bid adieu that same day. “Today is bittersweet for me as I finished my last shift at the New York Daily News … Stay tuned for my next exciting venture.”

Insiders said their departures were part of the Tronc reorganization that got rolling in March.

Interactive developer Kelli R. Parker also resigned recently after about a year on the job, since most of the jobs in that department were headed west as part of a consolidation of design and production for all the papers in Chicago.

An update: Patrick Soon-Shiong’s deal to acquire the Los Angeles Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune from Tronc for $500 million, announced in February, still has not closed. And McCormick Media, which was given a 10-day extension to complete its purchase of just over 25 percent of the stock now owned by ex-chairman Michael Ferro for $23 a share, also has not finalized its deal.

Tronc stock closed up 6 cents, at $16.39, on Tuesday.
