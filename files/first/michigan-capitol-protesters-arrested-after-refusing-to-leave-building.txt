The protest was part of the Michigan Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival. Protesters on Tuesday sought to raise interest in issues related to war, militarism and national priorities. Police say those arrested were given appearance citations, so they weren't jailed.

The same group protested May 21 at the Grand Tower building in Lansing, where 16 arrests were made. Weekly protests are planned through mid-June.
