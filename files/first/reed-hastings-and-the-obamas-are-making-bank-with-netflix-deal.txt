Reed Hastings, the founder, chairman and CEO of Netflix, had quite a run last week.

The darling of streaming saw his company pass Disney and Comcast in market cap as his stock hit an all-time high of $352.90 a share.

Hastings also notched a multiyear deal with former President Barack Obama and wife Michelle’s production company, Higher Ground Productions, to produce “films and series for Netflix, potentially including scripted series, unscripted series, docu-series, documentaries and features,” the company said.

You could say both Hastings and the Obamas did fairly well over the past decade or so.

Netflix in 2007 had a $3 share price and was mailing DVDs to people. The Obamas were poised to enter the White House and then had a reported net worth of $1.3 million, according to CNN Money.

Fast-forward to 2018. The Obamas have an estimated combined net worth of $75 million, according to published reports, mainly derived from speeches and a two-book deal with Penguin Random House.

Hastings’ move to streaming helped him amass $4.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The Obama-Netflix production deal — on which which neither party will put a value — was most likely helped along by new Netflix board member Susan Rice, who served as Obama’s national security adviser.

Nevertheless, the Obamas are certainly on their way to becoming very rich in the post-White House phase of their life.

You could say they have become true-blue capitalists, using their clout to create a new media empire spanning books, documentaries and feature films.

This capitalist bent is quite a departure from Obama’s policy decisions when he was in the White House.

I say welcome to capitalism, Mr. President. A little too late, yes, but welcome anyway.

Congratulations!
