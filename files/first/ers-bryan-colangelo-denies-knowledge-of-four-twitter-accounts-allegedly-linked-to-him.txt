Philadelphia 76ers president of basketball operations Bryan Colangelo told USA TODAY Sports he has no knowledge of the origin or motives of four Twitter accounts he allegedly is linked to, according to a story published Tuesday by The Ringer.

Tweets critical of the Sixersâ€™ rebuild and critical of players on the team were sent from several different Twitter accounts that, according to The Ringer, are linked to Colangelo.

The fifth Twitter account in question (@Phila1234567) belonged to Colangelo, the Sixers confirmed to The Ringer. Colangelo said he used it to monitor NBA news.

Colangelo is a longtime NBA executive and the son of Basketball Hall of Famer Jerry Colangelo, who made his name as an NBA executive, owner of the Phoenix Suns and chairman of USA Basketball.
