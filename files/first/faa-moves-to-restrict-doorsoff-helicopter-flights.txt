The FAA is moving to temporarily grounding doors-off helicopter tour flights in which passengers are tethered to the aircraft, after the March 11 crash in New York City of a Liberty Helicopters Airbus AS350 that killed five people.

“The FAA will order operators and pilots to take immediate actions to control or mitigate this risk,” the agency said in a statement. “Until then, the FAA will order no more ‘doors off’ operations that involve restraints that cannot be released quickly in an emergency.” The agency is also conducting a “top to bottom review” of the rules governing the operations.

The helicopter air tour industry has begun offering people the chance to photograph landmarks in New York City and Hawaii from helicopters with the doors removed. To keep people from falling out, passengers are often tethered to the helicopter using harnesses. The tether systems in the chartered Liberty Helicopters crash required a knife to cut free from the harness.
