When possible, choose a fixed system over installing a port (into which you jam the nozzle of a portable extinguisher); ports can allow additional air into the engine compartment, which only helps the fire burn, and obviously, they can’t be triggered automatically if you’re asleep or off the boat.

Electrical systems and batteries are responsible for triggering 52 percent of those blazes, fuel systems get 5 percent of the blame, and flammable items coming into contact with an overheated exhaust system accounts for another 20 percent. That means Class A fires (combustible materials that leave ash), Class B fires (flammable liquids) and Class C fires (electrical) are all possibilities in the engine room. The net result? Boats with engine rooms need a fixed, automatic fire-extinguishing system that can handle all three.

Size Matters

The volume of your engine room or engine compartment is what determines the size of the system you need. “Get more than the minimum, because the minimum is often not enough and more is always better,” says Bob Daley, a 26-year veteran captain (retired) of the Montgomery County Fire Rescue. Daley’s own boat is equipped with three times the required extinguishers.

To figure out what size system you need, measure the length, width and height of your engine room and calculate the cubic feet. Fixed systems are rated by cubic feet of ­coverage.
