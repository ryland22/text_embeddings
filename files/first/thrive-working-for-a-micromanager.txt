If you have ever worked for a micromanager, you’ll probably never forget the experience. It’s an uncomfortable working relationship that no doubt requires both resilience and learned skills in order to survive.

The very definition of a micromanager sounds discouraging to career growth, “manage with excessive control or attention on details”. After all who would be attracted to an opportunity where your work was scrutinized routinely, being checked and double checked for accuracy?

Most people shy away from working with a micromanager and for good reason, their obsessive behavior with control leads to a work place where motivation and enthusiasm is diminished.

Working for a micromanager can make you question your skills — why would they hire me, if I couldn’t do the job?



The mixed message you hear is, “I hired you to do the job because you have the skills but I need to step in and control everything you do because you may not do it right.” A lack of trust is at the center of every conflicting message and if you aren’t careful it can take a vibrant career and take it off track.

The time spent under a watchful eye can lead to career lethargy which in turn can send the wrong perception to others that you lack drive and initiative.

The truth is working for a micromanager is difficult but not impossible. With practice you can implement some new tactics that have helped others while gaining experience in your career and maintaining your confidence.

First, keep in mind that most micromanagers aren’t out to destroy your career, it’s not a personal attack rather it is their inability to trust. Keeping a healthy perspective helps you cope with a micromanager’s need to check and verify over and over again.

Here are suggestions to help manage a micromanager:

• Do prepare in advance for their need to control, lean toward over-communicating and keep them informed before problems arise.

• Do take the initiative to communicate the progress on daily tasks and current projects without being asked, this helps build trust.

• Don’t take to heart the daily critiques and criticism a micromanager gives rather listen for cues and pay attention to their hot button issues. Their advice teaches you what bothers them and helps you prepare in advance.

• Don’t expect reasoning to work when talking with a micromanager, unless they are open to change. Talking about their excessive managing will only encourage more of the same.

• Don’t get defensive it leads to their notion that you need more guidance. Ironically, asking for their advice tends to build rapport and shows you are interested in learning from them.

• Learn from them, their need for results can help you strengthen your sense of urgency and help you become more organized for future career opportunities.

While micromanagers are challenging, don’t give them the power to ruin your happiness at work. If you find yourself too miserable to face another work week, take charge and start searching for new opportunities.
