California –-(Ammoland.com)- 1911 pistol fans, you have to love Ares Armor, as they are definitely not afraid to stick it to the man, in this case the ATF.

Ares Armor has a new product that follows on the heals of their controversial 80% AR15 receivers, this time its a 80% hand gun receiver for the 1911 pistol. The difference between a finished that you need to transfer through a Federal Firearms Dealer and an 80% receiver you can order through the mail is the slide rails, hammer and sear pin holes, as well as the barrel seat still need to be machined to complete the frame.

Now you can make your own personal handgun at home, with no involvement from the FBI, ATF, your local FFL and with no barckground checks.

We know this will upset so many freedom haters that don't trust themselves to safely and legally own guns and think we have to be watched over and our privacy invaded just to exercise our GOD given rights, but that is the beauty of America. You can legally build and keep your own weapons for your own personal protection.

It is called the 1911 Rudius Frame and it retails for $249.95 but you can expect that price to come down as you buy more. Just pick up some basic 1911 parts and get started.

Says Ares Armor “We designed the Rudius with the user in mind. The 1911 Rudius Frame is a Billet made from stress proof 1144 steel to increase strength and reduce residual stress. The 80% 1911 Rudius Frame is the perfect project for an at-home build. This build a firearm product is not a complete firearm until you decide to make it one. To complete the 1911 Rudius frame all that need be done are: (1) slide rails; (2) barrel seat; and (3) three rear pin holes. We also are having our tooling custom made. We will not be using standard off the shelf tooling because it will not meet the original 1911 spec. “

So with that, we will be offering the following for purchase:

a ball end mill to cut the barrel seat with a radius of 0.348 +0.0025/-0.000

a special cutter to cut the slide groves with a height of 0.119+/-0.002
