Event

On 25 May 2018, the Indonesian parliament’s lower house amended the 2003 anti-terrorism law, now enabling security forces to take pre-emptive action against suspected militants.

New measures include a legal basis to charge Islamic State-affiliated returnees from Iraq and Syria and an increase in the duration of preventive detention from seven days to up to 21 days. It also envisages a broader role for the Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI) to support the efforts of the police’s counter-terrorism unit, Densus 88. This follows a series of attacks on 13–14 May 2018, when suicide bombers detonated low-yield improvised explosive devices (IEDs) at three churches and a police headquarters across the East Java province.
