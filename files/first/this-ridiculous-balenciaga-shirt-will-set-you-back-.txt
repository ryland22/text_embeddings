Balenciaga, the storied European fashion house that gave us $850 platform Crocs, dorky dad sneakers and a $2,200 version of Ikea’s 99-cent blue plastic “Frakta” tote, is at it again.

Introducing the $1,290 “T-Shirt Shirt,” which is causing a stir on social media.

As the name suggests, this casual topper is essentially a T-shirt with a long-sleeved, button-down shirt sewn on top. As the website suggests, you can either wear the T-shirt with the long-sleeved shirt hanging from the front, or wear the long-sleeved shirt with the T-shirt hanging from the back. Made from 100 percent cotton, it’s available in three sizes — and is drawing a ton of ridicule, thanks to the pairing of its interesting aesthetic and hefty price tag.

Actor Michael Rapaport, a “T-Shirt Shirt” hater, tweeted, “They’re selling T-Shirt Shirts for $1,290 a pop? Are they even Butter Soft though? @BALENCIAGA y’all ar [sic] crazy for this one.”

Another disgruntled fashionista tweeted, “I’ll slap anyone who even tries to tell me that this is dope, Balenciaga clearly doesn’t care.”

Then again, there’s at least one fan out there. As an Instagram user posted, “Only $1,290 for the tshirt shirt and $15,000 for the denim jean shirt shirt? Idk about yall but these new #balenciaga threads are [fire emoji].”
