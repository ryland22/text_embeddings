On May 1st, the Iowa state Natural Resource Commission will be holding a public hearing to discuss potential rule changes, including Item 10 on the agenda to change subrule 106.7(2) and arbitrarily restrict handguns that may be used for hunting and set an arbitrary limit on the number of cartridges that may be loaded in a firearm. Please click the “Take Action” button below or email Tyler Harms directly at tyler.harms@dnr.iowa.gov to submit a comment to the Natural Resource Commission opposing these changes.





One change would prohibit hunting deer with handguns equipped with accessories that could potentially allow them to be fired from the shoulder. Such accessories do not affect muzzle velocity, muzzle energy, or bullet construction: metrics typically considered to determine how effectively and humanely a firearm may harvest game. In fact, these accessories are often used by hunters in order to stabilize handguns and allow them to shoot more accurately and thereby harvest game more humanely.

Another change would limit firearms to having no more than six rounds of ammunition loaded at a time while hunting. Regulations already set the number of game animals that can be harvested in bag limits. This arbitrary limit would not contribute to wildlife conservation or law enforcement efforts.

Again, please click the “Take Action” button below or email Tyler Harms directly at tyler.harms@dnr.iowa.gov to submit a comment to the Natural Resource Commission opposing these changes. In addition, hearing details may be found here and below.
