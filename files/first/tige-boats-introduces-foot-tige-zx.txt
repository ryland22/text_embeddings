Abilene, TX â€“Today, Tige Boats announced the introduction of the all-new ZX5. Coming in at 25 feet and loaded with new innovation, style, and more versatile than ever, the ZX5 will be the largest and deepest Tige ever to hit the market. This boat is bringing a new dimension to the lineup and is ready to take over even the biggest of lakes.

With seating for 19 and ample storage, the 25-foot Tige ZX5 will allow for your whole crew can come along for a day full of wakesurfing, wakeboarding, or skiing

With seating for 19 and ample storage, the 25-foot flagship will allow for your whole crew can come along for a day full of wakesurfing, wakeboarding, or skiing. Engage TAPS 3 and over 5 tons of wave-making power to see how our biggest boat is making the biggest wave yet. The surf performance of the ZX5 is in line with what you expect from a Tige -- it's long, powerful, and riders have even described it as "perfect". Wakeboarders can expect the massive, rampy wakes that the Convex V Hull is notorious for. This new king of the water can make the wake vanish when you are ready to ski and still performs with total agility when you take it into a turn. And when you're all done behind the boat, you can simply store your boards in the Surf Locker storage to keep your cockpit dry and tidy.

Standard with industry-leading features, the ZX5 boasts the TAPS 3 Surf System, Patented Convex V Hull, Tige CLEAR User Experience, and the Alpha E2 Powered Tower. Other notable standard features include Indmar Raptor Series, transform seating, Surf + Wake XL Underfloor Ballast, RearView Camera, Tige 5 Warranty, and the Lifetime Hull Replacement Warranty.
