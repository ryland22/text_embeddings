Ocala Police say a 30-year-old man is in critical condition Sunday after he broke into his ex-girlfriend's house and was shot by her adult son.

Police say it started about 1 a.m. when a woman received an alert from her security camera system that her ex-boyfriend was trying to enter her home at the 4500 block of SE 14th St. The woman was out of town but her children were home. The suspect fled before police arrived.



Police say the man returned at 4 a.m. and got inside the house. They say the woman's adult son shot the suspect as he ran toward his younger siblings' bedroom. They say the wounded suspect jumped out of a second-story window and officers found him a few blocks away. He was taken to a local hospital in critical condition.

Police have deemed it a justifiable shooting.

The suspect's name has not been released.
