Brigitte Nielsen is ready to give motherhood another shot.

The Danish actress, 54, revealed she was expecting her fifth child on Instagram earlier this week.

“family getting larger [heart emoji],” she wrote alongside a photo showing off her rather sizable baby bump.

After getting her start as a model at the beginning of the ‘80s, Nielsen starred in the fantasy film “Red Sonja” in 1985, which co-starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. That year she also appeared in “Rocky IV” with then-husband Sylvester Stallone, who she also starred alongside in “Cobra” the next year.

Nielsen, who’s been married five times, already has four sons, ranging in age from 23 to 34.

A rep for the actress did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
