Ford’s insanely popular F-150 Raptor off-road race truck will add electronically controlled adaptive shock absorbers for a smoother ride and better control when the 2019 model goes on sale late this year.

The new Fox Racing Shox are joined by an electronic system that functions like cruise control for the most challenging off-road conditions, Recaro sport seats and a few cosmetic changes.

The shock absorbers have three settings — normal, sport and off-road. They’re engaged by the electronic drive control, which modifies the suspension, steering, engine and transmission for a variety of conditions on the road and off. The shocks’ stiffness and damping can change every millisecond.

One example of their operation is “jump mode,” in which the sensors detect the load getting lighter, realize the truck is about to go airborne and stiffen the shocks for maximum damping so the truck doesn’t bottom out when it returns to the ground. A solenoid mounted on the shocks varies pressure on the fluid, increasing the hydraulic pressure up to 400 pounds in extreme conditions.

The 2019 Raptor will also add contrasting color lettering for the massive “Raptor” stamped on its tailgate, carbon fiber interior trim and new exterior colors.

Prices and fuel economy will be announced closer to when the ’19 Raptor goes on sale. The 2018 Raptor has a 450-hp twin-turbo V6, 10-speed automatic transmission and a $50,115 base price.
