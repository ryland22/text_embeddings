US business aviation services company and EBACE regular Meridian has added a Gulfstream G450 to its managed fleet, taking its number of – almost entirely large-cabin – aircraft available for charter to 22.

The Teterboro, New Jersey-based firm has been expanding its footprint at the business aviation airport where it already has a fixed-base operation and Part 145 repair station. It is this month opening a 4,000m2 (43,056 ft2) hangar for its jets there, replacing a 1950s building that “we have simply outgrown”, says director of marketing Kirk Stephen.

Meridian – which began just after the Second World War adapting surplus combat aircraft for civil use, and is still owned by the same family – also established a West Coast FBO in late 2016, at Hayward Executive Airport near San Francisco.

The 2009 G450 joins a fleet that includes 11 Gulfstreams, six Bombardier Challengers, and four Dassault Falcons.

Stephen says being at EBACE allows Meridian “an opportunity to get exposure to European operators coming into the USA through Teterboro, and also to those looking for lift in the US”. He adds: “It’s a great venue to brand ourselves in the European market.”
