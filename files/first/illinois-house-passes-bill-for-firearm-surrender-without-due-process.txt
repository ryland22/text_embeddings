On May 23rd, the Illinois state House of Representatives voted 80-32 to pass House Amendment 2 to House Bill 2354 to allow Second Amendment rights to be revoked without due process. HA 2 to HB 2354 now goes to the state Senate for further consideration. Please contact your state Senator and urge them to OPPOSE HA 2 to HB 2354.

House Amendment 2 to House Bill 2354, sponsored by Rep. Kathleen Willis (D-77), would allow for the issuance of protective orders to infringe on Second Amendment rights based on third party allegations with little, if any, real evidence and limited “due process” for the respondent. Hearings for the orders would be ex parte, where the respondent is not present to challenge the accuser and defend against allegations made against them. The issuance of an order would immediately prohibit the respondent from exercising their Second Amendment rights. The Right to Keep and Bear Arms should not be treated as a second-class right and should only be restricted consistent with the constitutional requirements of due process.

Further, for truly dangerous individuals, this bill does nothing to incapacitate the subjects of the orders, as there is no requirement that they receive mental health treatment.
