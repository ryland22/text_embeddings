Spotlight on the New Cessna Citation Longitude

Textron Aviation is now in full production of its new super midsize Citation Longitude, and the company expects FAA certification any day now. Once certified, the aircraft will be the company’s largest to reach market to date, pending development of the now-suspended Hemisphere program.

Textron recently flew one of the Longitude test aircraft 31,000 nautical miles on tour around the globe. While it was in Singapore, we had the chance to check it out and talk to Rosa Lee Argotsinger, director of aftermarket sales, about what this new business jet brings to the market.
