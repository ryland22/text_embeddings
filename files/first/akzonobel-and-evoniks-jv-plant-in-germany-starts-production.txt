AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals and Evonik Industries have started production of chlorine and potassium hydroxide at their new joint venture (JV) facility in Germany.

Located at AkzoNobel’s Ibbenbüren site, the plant uses membrane electrolysis technology and has the capacity for up to 120,000mt of potassium hydroxide and 75,000mt of chlorine per annum.

Also producing hydrogen, the facility is expected to bolster the respective positions of both firms. The chlorine and hydrogen manufactured at the JV will be received by AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals.



However, the potassium hydroxide will be marketed by Evonik, which would convert some amount of the output at its Lülsdorf site into other products such as potassium carbonate, bicarbonate, and formate.

“As well as securing the long-term supply of our customers, our sustainability profile and operational efficiency will also further improve.”

AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals CEO Werner Fuhrmann said: “The Ibbenbüren facility sets a new benchmark in the chlor-alkali industry. As well as securing the long-term supply of our customers, our sustainability profile and operational efficiency will also further improve.”

The new production process adopted at the site is expected to improve the ecological footprint of each tonne of chlorine by 25% to 30%, leading to lowered energy use, expenses and CO 2 emissions.

Evonik executive board member and deputy chairman Dr Harald Schwager said: “Throughout the project, we have proven that two experienced partners can bring in their broad expertise and intelligently shape their business environment together.

“We complement each other very well and look forward to the continued collaboration that benefits our customers, and ultimately the market for potassium hydroxide.”
