The German Army's Panzerbataillon (Armour Battalion) 414, which includes a Dutch tank company, received its first Leopard 2A6MA2 recently, the Bundeswehr announced on 25 May. The remaining 16 main battle tanks are scheduled to be delivered to the battalion in Lohheide, northern Germany, by the end of June, the Bundeswehr added.

Panzerbataillon 414, which the German and Dutch armies began forming in 2015, comes under the command of the Royal Netherlands Army's 43 Mechanised Brigade, which is in turn part of the German 1st Panzer Division.

Panzerbataillon 414 Commander Lieutenant Colonel Marco Niemeyer described the “hand over - take over” of the Leopard 2A6MA2, which will equip the Dutch tank company, as a major step in the integration of the unit, with the tank's Dutch Essential Land based Information Application & Services (ELIAS) battlefield management system providing technical interoperability with 43 Mechanised Brigade.

Panzerbataillon 414's German Leopard 2s will also be upgraded to the 2A6MA2 standard and equipped with ELIAS so they can operate with 43 Mechanised Brigade, bringing the total number of tanks to be upgraded to 48.
