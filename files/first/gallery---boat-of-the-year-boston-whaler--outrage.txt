With its luxurious bow, ergonomic helm and below-deck creature comforts, the 420 Outrage is adept at fishing, cruising and entertaining.

Boating editors test more boats, with more in-depth analysis, than any other entity. We tested 150-plus boats in 2015, and Boston Whaler’s 420 Outrage stood out above the rest.

Our selection process is rigorous. The boat’s test must be published in Boating during the year of contention. The boat must comply with all American Boat and Yacht Council standards as revealed during our testing. The boat must fulfill the mission for which its builder states it is worthy. It must advance the art of boatbuilding and the sport of boating. And since boats come in such a wide variety of sizes and types, in-category comparison is key to our team’s entire selection process.

Boston Whaler’s 420 Outrage ranked higher in its category than any other tested boat ranked in any other category. It incorporates Whaler Watch, a tablet-based system operated from a custom iPad app that monitors security, marine electronics and digital-switching solutions. Its execution of second-row seating that doesn’t eat cockpit space is flawless. The lounge forward of the upper station is unique and provides a magnificent experience. Our testers felt the 420 Outrage planed more easily and had a better all-around ride than other boats they’ve tested. Its cabin rated best in its class, largely due to Whaler’s courageous decision to step the forward deck. This 42-foot boat is unsinkable and unquestionably Boating’s 2015 Boat of the Year.
