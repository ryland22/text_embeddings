"Two things are increasingly clear," writes David French of the National Review. "First, the United States has a growing problem with actual or attempted spree killers. And second, armed and alert citizens can be part of the solution."

If you haven’t read the FBI’s recently released report entitled “Active Shooter Incidents in the United States in 2016 and 2017,” and you care about gun rights, you should do so](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/active-shooter-incidents-us-2016-2017.pdf/view).

This opening line from a story on nationalreview.com sums it up well:

“After reading the FBI’s latest report on active-shooter incidents in the United States, two things are increasingly clear. First, the United States has a growing problem with actual or attempted spree killers. And second, armed and alert citizens can be part of the solution.”

First let’s get this out of the way: The FBI defends an “active shooter” as “one or more individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area.”

While gun violence overall is down since the 1990s, active shooter incidents are on the rise.

Between 200 and 2013, there were an average of 11.4 incidents each year. There was just one in 2000 and a high of 26 in 2010. There were 50 incidents in the past two years alone, 20 in 2016 and 30 in 2017, resulting 221 deaths.

While gun ownership has been steadily on the rise in the past 20 years, it doesn’t seem to correlate to the number of these types of incidents in any given year.
