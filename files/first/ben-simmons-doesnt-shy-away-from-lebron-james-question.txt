The NBA Finals haven’t even started yet, and speculation about where LeBron James might end up in free agency is already brewing.

Rookie of the Year candidate Ben Simmons — whose 76ers were ousted in the playoffs by the Celtics, the team James would go on to beat in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals on Sunday night — imagined entering his sophomore campaign with the four-time NBA MVP. Along with the Lakers, the 76ers are one of the teams that surface most frequently in connection with James’ future.

“There’s only one way to find out,” Simmons told TMZ in response to a question of whether he and James — both primary ball-handlers — would fit playing on the same team.

Simmons is represented by Klutch Sports Group, the agency founded by Rich Paul, James’ longtime friend and agent, so a partnership isn’t out of the question. But there are still a Finals to play, a fourth-straight Warriors-Cavaliers showdown, and James has some historically unfavorable odds to overcome.
