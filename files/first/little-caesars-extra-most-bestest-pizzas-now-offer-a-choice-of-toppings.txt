Instead of ordering Little Caesars' Pizza Pizza, you can now order topping topping.

The company has expanded its Extra Most Bestest pizza line to include more cheese and more toppings. As of this week, you can create your own Extra Most Bestest Pizza with the toppings of your choice.

Think of it as an upgrade of Little Caesars' Hot-N-Ready pizzas, which the company says are focused on value, quality and convenience. You'll be able to custom-order your pizza via the Little Caesars mobile app and, if you like, pick it up at stores that have Pizza Portals.

Pizza prices, which will vary, start at $6. Topping prices will vary by store. This is a permanent menu change, the company says, and it's being made at stores nationwide.

“Last year, Little Caesars introduced the $6 Extra Most Bestest pepperoni pizza, and its success has confirmed what we already knew … people love toppings,” said Ed Gleich, senior vice president of marketing, in a news release. "Create-your-own Extra Most Bestest pizzas was the next natural evolution of our great brand.”

Little Caesars has also revamped its mobile app to include a custom pizza builder to help customers select their toppings. Choices include pepperoni, bacon, beef, Italian sausage, ham, green peppers, onions and mushrooms. Most stores also offer black olives, jalapeno peppers, banana peppers and pineapple.

The Hot-N-Ready large pepperoni or cheese pizza ($5) and Detroit-style Deep!Deep! Dish ($8) will still be available at all stores.
