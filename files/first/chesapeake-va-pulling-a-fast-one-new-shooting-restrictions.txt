Virginia ‚Äì -(Ammoland.com)- It has been brought to Virginia Citizens Defense League‚Äôs attention that Chesapeake is trying to fly some new shooting restrictions under the radar.

Well, that didn‚Äôt work, but we don‚Äôt have much time!

Chesapeake wants to greatly increase restrictions on where a person can lawfully shoot, requiring:

* exceptionally large tracks of land (50 acres or more)

* one owner or lessee

* land must be used primarily for agriculture or conservation

* landowner must get a permit from the police chief

* no ‚Äúgrandfathering‚Äù of current home ranges

This effectively DOUBLES OR TRIPLES THE ‚ÄúNO SHOOT‚Äù AREAS of Chesapeake!

The Chesapeake website is silent on the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù meeting on this proposal, and they are not expecting many to attend (gee, I wonder why? If nobody knows about it‚Ä¶).

URGENT ACTION ITEM

Chesapeake residents ‚Äì we need a big turnout for this one!

The meeting is being held at 6 PM on Wednesday, July 20th 2016 at:

Chesapeake Sheriff‚Äôs Administration Building

Training Room

401 Albemarle Drive (corner of Holt Drive and Albemarle Drive)

Chesapeake, VA

**You MUST SIGN UP TO ATTEND the meeting and need to do so ASAP**:

Call Karen Green with the Chesapeake Police Department at 757-382-6404 or email her at [email protected] to sign up to attend (only 10 people are signed up, but I‚Äôm betting that is about to change üòâ )

I will be running the Virginia Citizens Defense League membership meeting that night in Newport News, but Board of Directors member John Fenter will be at the Chesapeake meeting representing Virginia Citizens Defense League .
