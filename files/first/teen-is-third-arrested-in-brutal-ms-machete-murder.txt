A third man linked to the notorious MS-13 gang has been charged in the machete murder of a Long Island teenager, according to officials.

Josue Figueroa-Velasquez, 18, was arrested Tuesday and charged with the slaying of 16-year-old Angel Soler, authorities said.

Soler’s mutilated remains were found in a wooded area in Roosevelt in October 2017, about three months after he was reported missing.

Soler’s was one of three bodies found within a five-mile stretch in Nassau County across nine days last fall — all apparent victims of MS-13 violence.

Two reputed members of the ruthless gang — David Sosa-Guevara and Victor Lopez — have already been charged in the slaying.

Figueroa-Velasquez pleaded not guilty during a brief court appearance Wednesday morning, according to the Nassau County District Attorney’s Office.

He was remanded without bail, and is due back in court Friday.
