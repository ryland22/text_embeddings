Picking on the Nets is low-hanging fruit. That’s what happens when you take up residence in the NBA cellar. ESPN’s Jalen Rose got into the act Tuesday, leaving at least one Net clapping back and their fans triggered.

Rose — while making a point about how the NBA is vocation and not avocation — said on “Get Up,” ESPN’s morning show based in New York City, “I promise you, the Nets — they play right here in Brooklyn — those players are not exchanging texts with each other this offseason.”

But Brooklyn begs to differ. The Nets say they’re not texting — they’re busy actually hanging out with each other after their 28-54 season that left them 12th in the Eastern Conference.

Nets point guard Jeremy Lin responded quickly on social media, tweeting that he had all of his teammates over to his home last week for a barbecue.

“Hmm Jalen much respect to you but no idea where this came from lol. I just had the whole team over for a fat bbq last week. These are my homies…even @IAmCHAP24 lol,” Lin tweeted, calling on teammate Rondae Hollis-Jefferson.

The forward promptly weighed in with a tweet defending Lin’s take: “As a brotherhood we enjoy every aspect of this growth process. #NextTimeYouComeToBKCheckIn”

It was far from the only time the Nets have converged in each other’s company this offseason. They spent time together in Los Angeles earlier this month, with all but two players on the 15-man roster in Hollywood.

Veteran center Timofey Mozgov — who played for the Lakers before coming to Brooklyn — hosted a number of them at his Los Angeles residence during their West Coast getaway. And DeMarre Carroll, who has emerged as a team leader and grown-up in the locker room, shared a picture of the Nets working out in what looks like the Hollywood Hills.

One Brooklyn fan even compiled a video, complete with music, of the Nets joking around and enjoying each other’s company this offseason.
