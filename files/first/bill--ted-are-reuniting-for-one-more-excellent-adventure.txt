Reeves says a script has been hanging around for eight years, but the film has been stalled for one reason or another. Now Face the Music has officially entered pre-production.

Instead, the duo will have to navigate the daily struggles of adulthood while trying to create the song that will save the universe.

No word yet on a possible release date, but with Excellent Adventure's 30th anniversary approaching in 2019, that'd seem like a good bet.
