The American Dream promises to all the opportunity to attain financial security -- and even wealth -- through hard work. Just how widespread these opportunities are is a matter of debate, but there are towns that serve as evidence that the American Dream is alive and well, at least for some.

In almost every state -- rich or poor -- there is at least one town where most households earn far more than the typical state resident and the typical American. Though separated by vast distances, the states' wealthiest towns often have more in common with each other than with other communities in the same state -- even some that may be just a few miles down the road.

Almost without exception, the wealthiest towns have expensive real estate and are home to well-educated populations. With relatively high median incomes, they are also often home to large shares of extremely wealthy households -- those earning $200,000 or more -- and have relatively few residents living below the poverty line. Additionally, more often than not, the wealthiest town in each state is within commuting distance of a large city.

24/7 Wall Street reviewed the median annual household income in every American town with a population between 1,000 and 25,000 to identify the wealthiest town in each state. For comparison purposes, boroughs, census designated places, borough, cities, towns, and villages were all considered.

Mountain Brook, Alabama

Median household income: $129,777 (state: $44,758)

$129,777 (state: $44,758) Households earning $200,000 or more: 31.3% (state: 2.9%)

$557,300 (state: $128,500) Population: 20,532

The Birmingham suburb of Mountain Brook ranks as the wealthiest town in Alabama and one of only two towns in the state where most households earn six-figure incomes. Further underscoring the area's overall wealth is the near absence of poverty. Just 3.2% of area residents live in poverty, a fraction of the statewide poverty rate of 18.4%.

Higher educational attainment opens the door to higher-paying jobs, and wealthier populations tend to be better educated. In Mountain Brook, 85.1% of adults have a bachelor’s degree or higher, the largest share of any town in the state and the fourth largest share in the country.

Fishhook, Alaska

Fishhook is the wealthiest town in the second wealthiest state. The typical area household earns $95,030, above both the median income in Alaska of $74,444 and the nationwide median income of $55,322. Not only does Fishhook have the highest median income of any town in the state, but it also has the lowest poverty rate. Just 4.9% of area residents live below the poverty line, less than half the state poverty rate of 10.1% and less than a third of the 15.1% U.S. poverty rate.

Most wealthy American towns are well educated, but Fishhook is an exception. Just 28.3% of area adults have a bachelor’s degree or higher, below both the 28.8% college attainment rate statewide and the 30.3% rate nationwide. A high median income and low educational attainment rate is partially due to the types of jobs available in the area. The region has higher than typical employment in installation, maintenance, and repair -- jobs than can be relatively high paying without high education requirements.

Not only is Great Falls the wealthiest town in Virginia, but also it is one of the wealthiest in the country. The typical household in Great Falls earns $230,304 a year, well more than triple the median income of $66,149 across Virginia.

Along with Travilah, Maryland, Great Falls is one of two D.C. suburbs on this list. In both towns, the high incomes are largely attributable to high-skilled, high-paying jobs with contractors and government agencies in and around the nation’s capital. Such jobs often require high education, and in Great Falls, 81.9% of adults have a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to 36.9% of adults in Virginia and 30.3% of American adults.

As is often the case, property is expensive in Washington’s highest earning town. The typical area home is worth $624,900 -- well more than double the median home value of $269,300 across the state as a whole.

Bar Nunn, Wyoming

Median household income: $73,800 (state: $59,143)

$73,800 (state: $59,143) Households earning $200,000 or more: 2.9% (state: 3.5%)

$211,000 (state: $199,900) Population: 2,682

Bar Nunn is a town just north of Casper along Interstate 25. The typical household in the town earns $73,800 a year, the most of any town in Wyoming. Most wealthy American towns are well educated, but Bar Nunn is an exception. Just 17.7% of area adults have a bachelor’s degree or higher, below both the 26.0% college attainment rate statewide and the 30.3% rate nationwide. Additionally, despite the high median income, there are very few extremely wealthy town residents. Just 2.9% of Bar Nunn households earn $200,000 or more per year, less than the comparable 3.5% state and 5.7% U.S. shares.

The low educational attainment and lack of extremely high incomes are partially explained by the types of jobs available in the area. The region has far higher than typical employment in construction and extraction occupations, fields than can be relatively high paying without high education requirements.

Detailed findings and methodology

Many high-paying jobs require a four-year college degree. Partially as a result, most of the wealthiest towns in each state are home to relatively large college-educated populations. In 46 of the 50 towns on this list, the share of adults with at least a bachelor’s degree is greater than the corresponding statewide share, as well as the nationwide share of 30.3%.

The town with the highest median income in each state is also often an expensive place. Not only can higher income individuals afford more expensive real estate, but high real estate costs also drive up median incomes as they attract higher income residents and are often often prohibitively expensive for most Americans.

Nationwide, the typical home is worth $184,700, and all but three towns on this list have higher median home values. In all of the towns on this list, the median home value exceeds the median home value across the state as a whole.

Across the United States, wealthy towns are often situated in close proximity to large cities. Major urban areas are more likely to offer a wide range of high-paying jobs as well as a high concentration of cultural amenities like museums, theatres, concert venues, and professional sports teams.

The majority of towns on this list are well within commuting distance of a major urban center, which is often either the state capital, the largest city, or both. The towns on this list include suburbs of such cities as Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Milwaukee, New York, Seattle, St. Louis, and Washington D.C.

Though a high median household income does not necessarily suggest a concentration of extreme wealth, many towns on this list are home to clusters of the wealthiest Americans. In all but three towns on this list, the concentration of households earning at least $200,000 a year is higher than it is across the state as a whole. In seven towns on this list -- including two New York City suburbs and two Washington D.C. suburbs -- over half of all households earn $200,000 a year or more.

To determine the wealthiest town in each state, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed median household incomes in every town, city, village, borough, or census designated place, with a population between 1,000 and 25,000 in each state from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Our list includes census designated places, which are unincorporated regions that are treated as towns for statistical purposes. All social and economic figures are based on five-year estimates for the period of 2012-2016. To control for potential data errors that can arise in low population areas, we did not consider towns where the margin of error at 90% confidence was greater than 10% of the point estimate of both median household income and population. We considered the percentage of adults who have at least a bachelor’s degree, the share with a high school diploma, the towns’ poverty rates, and median home value — all from the ACS. Regional price parity -- or cost of living -- by state is for the most recent available year from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
