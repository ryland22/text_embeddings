Bern-based Mountain Flyers has signed an order to acquire a Leonardo AW169 medium-twin helicopter with a VIP interior.

The order signing at Leonardo’s booth at EBACE on Tuesday will expand the charter operator’s fleet, says Mounter Flyers chief executive Christoph Graf.

Mountain Flyers now operates a single AW109, but the light twin helicopter’s payload is not enough for some customers, Graf says.

The AW169 will help the company on regular charter trips to several destinations within Switzerland, as well as on long-range routes to Nice and Monaco.

Leonardo has signed more than 180 orders and commitments for the AW169, of which about 50 have been delivered, the company says.
