Qatar Petroleum has invited proposals from international firms to partner on building and operating a petrochemicals complex in Ras Laffan Industrial City.

The new petrochemicals complex will feature an ethane cracker with a capacity to hold more than 1.6 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of ethylene.

Upon completion, the new ethane cracker would be the largest in the Middle East, and also one of the largest in the world.



Qatar Petroleum president and CEO Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi said: “This development is a first step towards the launch of a new world-scale Petrochemicals Complex at Ras Laffan, marking another important milestone for Qatar Petroleum.”

“This project will complement our efforts to implement our strategy, and will enable Qatar Petroleum to further expand its footprint in the global petrochemicals markets.”

Additionally, the petrochemicals complex will also have derivative plants, which will further strengthen Qatar’s position among the petrochemicals producers in the global market.

The feedstock for the new petrochemical complex will be ethane that will be produced mainly at the new North Field LNG expansion project that would produce an additional 23Mtpa of LNG, as well as from existing gas projects producing ethane.

Al-Kaabi further added: “Petrochemicals represent a major pillar of our growth strategy to achieve our vision of becoming one of the best national oil companies in the world.

“This project will complement our efforts to implement our strategy, and will enable Qatar Petroleum to further expand its footprint in the global petrochemicals markets.”

Engineering design of the petrochemicals complex is expected to begin shortly, with start-up being planned for 2025.
