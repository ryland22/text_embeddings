An investigation into the mysterious downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine concluded that the plane was shot down by the Russian military. The investigation identified a Russian military convoy in the area when the airliner was shot down and even the individual surface-to-air missile launcher, in large part through analysis of photos found on social media.

In a press conference streamed on YouTube, Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team concluded that MH17 was shot down by a Buk anti-air missile that was part of the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, based in Kursk, Russia. A convoy from the 53rd brigade travelled from Kursk to the area of the shootdown in late June, and was in position to fire when the aircraft was destroyed on July 17th, 2014. The convoy included several Buk TELARs, or all-in-one “transporter erector launcher and radar” vehicles that mount both the radar and interceptor missiles on a single vehicle platform.

The criminal investigation included a video showing the home base of the 53rd Brigade, and pictures of a convoy that departed the base on June 23rd. Dozens of photos of the convoy were taken and posted on Russian social media, including VK. Features on the road, particularly street signs, matched up exactly with Google Street View as the convoy wound its way south. License plate numbers and other details were recorded and matched up with vehicles later spotted in eastern Ukraine, proving the convoy had taken Buk missile launch vehicles there.

All military vehicles have identifying marks allowing friendly forces to keep track of them. In the case of the BUK launchers, they had a three digit number in white paint on the side. In Russian Army practice, the first number identifies the battalion, the second the company, and the third the individual vehicle. Most Buks in the convoy started with “2”, meaning they were from the 2nd Battalion, 53rd Brigade. One vehicle, however, started with “3”—a 3rd battalion vehicle.

A month later, on the date of the incident, a TELAR was recorded on a Volvo vehicle carrier in the vicinity of the shootdown with its white identification numbers smeared. Other details on the vehicle however, including a replacement road wheel unlike the rest, conclusively pointed to it as the 3rd battalion TELAR.

The missile used in the attack was identified as one of the 9M38 series, a Russian government designation for Buk missiles. Parts of a 9M38 missile were found in the aircraft wreckage, in the bodies of passengers, and on the ground—including a large section of the missile casing and engine exhaust port. The investigation even detonated a 9M38 missile to compare the resulting debris to those found at the crash site.

The JIT press conference failed on one aspect—discussing exactly why the specific TELAR, known as 332, is thought to have shot down MH17. The press conference showed a computer graphic of a TELAR with only three of its four missiles, but did not say that that was how 332 was linked to the incident. According to a 2017 report (PDF) published by the open source analysis group Bellingcat there are photographs of 332 with four missiles shortly before the attack and photograph of the vehicle with just three missiles, heading towards Russia, after the attack.

Why were there so many incriminating pictures of the Russian Army vehicles? Wherever the convoy went pictures and video were taken and posted to social media. The convoy’s large size and disruption to local traffic ensured that.

The use of social media pictures and video, tools such as Google Street View, and other openly available data was instrumental in the positive identification of the 53rd Brigade as responsible for the attack. In the eastern Ukraine and future conflicts, governments, non-government entities such as Bellingcat, and even private individuals will have previously unheard of abilities to detect and analyze military activity.
