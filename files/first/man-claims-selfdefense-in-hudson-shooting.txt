The shooting of a man in Hudson on Sunday may have been an act of self-defense, officials said.

The Pasco County Sheriff's Office responded to reports of shots fired in the 15900 block of Brenda Street and made contact with a resident who admitted to shooting a 37-year-old man.

The resident told detectives a group of men showed up at his house and started yelling and breaking his windows. The man called 911, grabbed a gun and asked them to leave his property.

When one of the men charged at him, he fired several shots in his direction, hitting the man in the upper torso. After the shooting, all of the men fled the scene in a truck.

Deputies said a 37-year-old man arrived an area hospital with a gunshot wound to the shoulder. His injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.

The case remains under investigation.
