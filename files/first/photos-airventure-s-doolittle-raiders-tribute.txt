The weather for AirVenture 2017 in Oshkosh was downright perfect for the first two days of the annual air show. Yet for reasons known only to Mother Nature, the sky featured more clouds than aircraft on Wednesday, and it almost seemed like heavy rain would wash the excitement away. Fortunately, the rain kept its distance for most of the day, only arriving later in the evening as the fireworks show kicked off.

But even then, it wasn’t enough to drench the spirits of the many aviation enthusiasts in attendance.

Earlier in the day, AirVenture commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Doolittle Raid with an unreal and spectacular showcase of warbirds, topped off by the presence of the massive B-29 Superfortresses Doc and FiFi. And the biggest star of the show was 101-year-old Richard “Dick” Cole, the last surviving Doolittle Raider and the man who served as co-pilot to James Doolittle.

Not even a sky full of clouds and a little rain could ruin what was an otherwise perfect day at AirVenture.
