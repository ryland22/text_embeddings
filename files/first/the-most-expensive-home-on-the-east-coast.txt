In 2014, activist-investor Barry Rosenstein dropped $147 million on an 18-acre waterfront property in East Hampton, at the time the most money ever spent on a home in America.

But that record — at least in the Hamptons — may soon be broken.

Jule Pond in Water Mill is currently asking $175 million — now the most expensive house for sale in the Hamptons, and on the East Coast, for that matter.

The massive, 20,000-square-foot compound resides on a 42-acre strip of land bordered by lakes on each side and the Atlantic to the rear.

While the house itself has pedigree — it belonged to Henry Ford’s family, as a piece of their 235-acre “Fordune” retreat — like everywhere else in the area, you’re really paying for the land.

It boasts the largest piece of private ocean frontage in the Hamptons, according to Bespoke Real Estate’s Michael Cantwell, whose firm is marketing the pricey estate.

“The views are completely panoramic. Every direction you look, you are looking at water,” Cantwell says. “It’s not over-the-top inside. There aren’t bowling alleys or anything. But the scale of the property is really unusual.”

Meanwhile, 1080 Meadow Lane in Southampton (boasting the second-highest price on the market) is asking $150 million.

While the estate is “just” 14 acres of prime beachfront (currently configured as three separate lots), it also offers two houses (the larger of which tops out at 12,000 square feet), as well as what is certainly one of the Hamptons’ most coveted amenities: two private oceanside fairways with golf houses.
