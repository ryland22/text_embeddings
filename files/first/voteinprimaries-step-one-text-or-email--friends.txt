This year, the Free Press is enlisting its readers in a campaign to boost turnout in Michigan’s August primary election by personally recruiting their friends, neighbors and family members to vote on Tuesday, Aug. 7, or submit absentee ballots before then.

Specifically, we’re asking you to email or text at least 10 people you think may not be planning to vote in the primary and ask each of them to join you at the polls Aug. 7.

We hope each reader will follow up with phone calls or personal conversations with at least 5 of those 10 people, and drive or escort at least one of those 5 to the polls on Aug. 7.

Here’s some language you might wish to borrow or adapt in your initial email or text:

Dear __________:

I don’t know which party’s candidates you intend to vote for this November, and I’m not asking — or burdening you with my preferences, unless you really want to know.

But I hope you’ll join me in voting in the statewide primary on Tuesday, Aug. 7, because it may be the only chance either of us has to cast a meaningful vote in many of the races up for grabs this year.

Because most of Michigan’s congressional and legislative districts are drawn to favor either Democratic or Republican candidates, those who win the dominant party’s primary election in those districts is a cinch to win the general election in November. So if we fail to vote in the primary, we’re likely to be stuck with the candidate primary voters select.

The problem is that very few people vote in primaries. Fewer than one in five voters have turned out in all but one of the Michigan’s August primaries since 1998.

The League of Women Voters likes to say that democracy is not a spectator sport. I plan to get in the game by voting this Aug. 7 — and I hope you’ll join me.
