The Detroit Tigers lost to the Angels on Tuesday night.

Then, they lost two more players to the 10-day disabled list.

Left-hander Francisco Liriano will miss time with a right hamstring strain, manager Ron Gardenhire said, and so, too, will lefty Daniel Stumpf, who is sidelined with left ulnar nerve irritation.

Liriano is the biggest blow, both now and in the near future: The veteran has served as a stabilizing force of sorts for the Tigers’ rotation and figured as one of their prime trade pieces heading into the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline.

This season, Liriano has a 3.90 ERA and 1.21 WHIP in 10 starts. He’s struck out 45 batters out in 57 2/3 innings.

In Liriano’s place, the team will recall lefty Ryan Carpenter from Triple-A Toledo to fill his spot in the starting rotation.

Stumpf has struggled mightily as of late and now, the Tigers have one potential reason why: He had swelling in his elbow which caused tingling in his fingers, according to Gardenhire.

Stumpf, 27, has pitched in a major league-leading 28 games this season. He has posted a 5.71 ERA and 1.90 WHIP in 17 1/3 innings but has shown himself to be unproductive against lefty hitters, his main job.

Stumpf will be replaced by righty Johnny Barbato in the bullpen.

With Stumpf’s injury, the Tigers do not have a lefty reliever in the bullpen.
