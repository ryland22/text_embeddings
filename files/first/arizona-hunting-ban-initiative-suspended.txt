The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) and their front-group “Arizonans for Wildlife” have suspended their efforts to gather signatures for a ballot initiative that would have banned the hunting and trapping of mountain lions and bobcats in the state. This misguided initiative ignored the fact that hunting is a necessary tool used by the Arizona Game and Fish Department (AGFD) as part of their science-based, comprehensive game management plan. Maintaining targeted predator populations across the state helps to ensure that prey populations, such as deer, bighorn sheep, and antelope are kept at healthy levels.

Thank you for spreading the word to your family, friends, and fellow hunters to oppose this initiative. Your efforts helped to prevent HSUS and “Arizonans for Wildlife” from gathering the required 150,642 signatures to put the initiative on the ballot.

If passed, this initiative would have negated Arizona’s comprehensive, scientifically-based approach and severely curtailed AGFD’s ability to protect wildlife resources throughout the state. Hunting in Arizona supports critical wildlife and habitat conservation projects with funds generated through license fees and excise taxes paid by hunters under the Pittman-Robertson Act and is a vital contributor to the state’s economy.
