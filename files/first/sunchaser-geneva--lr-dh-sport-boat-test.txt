We Say: This single-engine 22-foot-length-overall pontoon proved powerful and smooth and offered a lot of amenities at a middle-of-the-road price point. The boat we ran for testing boasted the performance-enhancing X-Treme PR25 Performance Package and a 200 hp Evinrude E-Tec G2 outboard. So equipped, it delivered 42 lively miles per hour and accelerated from zero to 30 mph in 6.8 seconds. Go easy when pulling up novice skiers. As for fuel economy, it delivered 3.7 mpg cruising at 26 mph.

The Geneva’s interior layout swallows a large crew. In the bow, curved facing loungers invite relaxation and conversation. A pop-up changing station fits neatly into the rear bulkhead of the portside lounger. Amidships, the helm station is raised for better visibility. A standard Kicker audio system provides the soundtrack. Captain and co-pilot chairs are plush, high-backed and reclining. Astern, the seating arrangement mimics the bow setup with facing curved loungers separated by a transom access door. At the stern, there’s a short swim platform with a watersports tow and aluminum boarding ladder, and a set of speakers for those in the water. Underneath the seat cushions and behind the access doors, assembly and rigging quality met with our approval. Wiring and fuel-line runs proved easy to follow, and access to the batteries is good.
