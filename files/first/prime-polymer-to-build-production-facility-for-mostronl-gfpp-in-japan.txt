Japan’s Mitsui Chemicals has announced that its joint venture (JV) company Prime Polymer is planning to build a production facility for its Mostron-L glass fibre-reinforced polypropylene (GFPP).

Prime Polymer is owned by 65% owned by Mitsui Chemicals, while the remaining stake is owned by the Japanese petroleum company Idemitsu Kosan.

The new facility will be built in Japan’s Ichihara, Chiba Prefecture region and will have a production capacity of 3,500t per annum.



The new facility will be used by the company for producing Mostron-L, which is a composite material made by melting and mixing polypropylene (PP) resin with long glass fibres.

In addition to being a lightweight product, Mostron-L’s long glass fibres provide a balance between hardness and impact resistance.

Mostron-L is currently being used by car manufacturers in areas such as the unpainted insides of rear car doors.

According to the company, recent changes in the environmental regulations and a shift towards electric vehicles have led to increasing needs for automotive lightweighting and electrification.

As a result, demand is on the rise for fibre-reinforced resins and is expected to grow further for materials that can be substituted for metal.

The company anticipates these new developments would increase the demand for the fibre-reinforced resins.

In order to cope with the future demand, Mitsui Chemicals Group intends to establish its own manufacturing technology in this realm and work towards mass production.

Prime Polymer plans to expand the footprint of Mostron-L in the market.
