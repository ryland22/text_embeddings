Boeing has been authorised to begin preparatory work on a USD3.4 billion multiyear contract to supply newbuild and remanufactured AH-64E Apache Guardian attack helicopters to the US Army and Saudi Arabia, a company official told Jane’s on 17 May.

The authorisation to begin work on lots 7-11 production comprising 268 Apaches came in the form of a USD43.5 million contract modification issued by the Department of Defense on 16 May. “With this action, the US Army is authorising Boeing to begin work prior to definitisation on scope and pricing,” the company official said.

The USD3.4 billion deal awarded in March 2017 is the first multiyear contract for the Apache, and includes crew trainers, ground support equipment, spares, logistics, and engineering technical services. Including another contract modification for USD184.9 million, this deal now stands at approximately USD3.6 billion.
