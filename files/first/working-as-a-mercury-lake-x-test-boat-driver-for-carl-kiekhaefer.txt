Lombardi and Kiekhaefer. It would not be unusual to find a framed photo of either icon in any tavern in Wisconsin’s Lake Winnebago drainage. Each was a legend in his own time, each possessed an outsize personality and, decades after both have passed to the great beyond, each remains part of the region’s mythology.

For example, there must have been 5,000 altar boys who served Lombardi at Catholic Mass and will tell you about it today over a beer. And at least that many old men claim to have been impulsively fired by E.C. Kiekhaefer from a job assembling Mercury outboards. Or they watched Kiekhaefer fire the Pepsi delivery man.

And so, when I mentioned across the Lake View Inn bar my recent trip to Lake X, the fabled Mercury test facility in central Florida, I was not surprised that someone piped right up with a Kiekhaefer story.

“I once worked for the old man,” recalled my good friend Chuck Larson. “In fact, I was a test driver at Lake X.”

There was much eye rolling and groaning up and down the bar.

“No really,” said Chuck. “I have pictures to prove it.”
