Another alumni from Graydon Carter’s Vanity Fair has landed.

Jim Kelly, a contributing editor at VF for the past seven years and earlier the top editor at Time magazine, is joining Aevitas Creative Management, the literary agency formed by Todd Shuster and David Kuhn in 2016.

He said he’ll cast a wide net in his new career as a literary agent.

“My tenure at Time and Vanity Fair allowed me to be curious about everything, but I guess I lean toward biography and history,” Kelly said. “I also have a passion for crime, both real and imagined, which I guess is a consequence of growing up with a NYPD officer as my dad.”

Kelly bumped into Carter when they both started at Time within a week of one another in 1978 — and stayed friends as they advanced their publishing careers. Kelly capped his nearly 30-year career at Time as its top editor, then spent three more years as an editor at large.

Kelly’s VF contributing editor contract expired at the end of May, and he starts his new job on June 1.
