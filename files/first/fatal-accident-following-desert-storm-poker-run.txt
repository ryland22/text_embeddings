Two people are dead and a third was in extremely critical condition after a boat crashed Saturday, April 21, following the Desert Storm Poker Run and Shootout at Lake Havasu. The two men, Brad Kloepfer, 57, and Paul Selberg, 69, died at Havasu Regional Medical Center. The 58-year-old woman, Connie David Kloepfer (wife of Brad Kloepfer), was listed in extremely critical condition and was later flown to a Phoenix hospital for treatment, according to the Havasu News-Herald.

All three are from Lake Havasu City and were wearing life jackets. Kloepfer was an officer for the Redlands, California, Police Department from 1984 until his retirement in 2006, said Carl Baker, spokesman for the city.

All three were aboard the DCB Performance Boats M35 Widebody Lickity Split boat owned by J.P. O’Donoghue. The boat crashed about 12:30 p.m. in the south basin of the lake, near the Contact Point Water Safety Center, according to the Mohave County Sheriff’s Office in Arizona.
