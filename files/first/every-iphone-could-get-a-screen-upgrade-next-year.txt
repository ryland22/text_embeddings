Apple may be giving its next batch of iPhones a major upgrade.

The Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant has decided to adopt pricier OLED screens for all three of its iPhone models in 2019, according to a report.

Currently, OLED screens — which deliver brighter, more vibrant colors, while requiring less battery power to operate — are only available in the $1,000 iPhone X. All other iPhone models use less expensive LCD screens.

Previous rumors had Apple pegged to offer a mix of OLED and LCD iPhones next year for customers with different budgets.

Apple recently started planning new iPhone models and decided all three models would have OLED screens, according to South Korea’s Electronic Times, citing multiple unnamed industry sources.

The news sent shares of Apple’s LCD display suppliers tumbling. Japan Display, which produces most of Apple’s LCD screens, dropped more than 13 percent.

Shares of OLED panel producer LG Display climbed on the news, up nearly 1.5 percent Tuesday afternoon.

Apple’s next phones also are expected to ditch the home button entirely and embrace the iPhone X’s edge-to-edge screen and facial-recognition technology.
