It's another sobering year for volume sellers Ford and Vauxhall as they sit near the bottom of the 2015 Driver Power customer satisfaction survey's manufacturer chart, while premium maker Land Rover didn't fare much better.

Rock bottom of the manufacturer rankings was Chrysler, which is unsurprising as it no longer sells vehicles in the UK. Those that are on the road are mostly ageing designs and are regarded by owners as poor-quality cars.

In second to last place was Suzuki, and it seems the brand has done little to address criticism from owners in Driver Power last year. It has moved up two places in the chart, but one of these is due to Chevrolet dropping out of the table in 2015. Build quailty, in-car tech and ride quality were the major gripes drivers had with their Suzuki models.

Sitting just above Suzuki and Chrysler, in 30th place, is Vauxhall. That's despite the fact its Corsa and Astra ranked as the third and fifth best-selling cars in 2014 respectively. Owners told us ease of driving, seat comfort and in-car tech brought the brand down this year – proof that big sales don't mean customer satisfaction.

This was echoed by Ford, which finished in a marginally better 25th position. The company responsible for the Fiesta and Focus – first and second in the new car sales charts respectively last year – was criticised by owners for poor build quality.

Meanwhile, Land Rover owners showed that a premium image wasn't enough to keep them happy, as they ranked the company in 29th place. Reliability was a major issue, while running costs were also criticised. The latter isn't surprising for a company producing large, thirsty SUVs, although many owners complained specifically about steep servicing costs.
