Dongming Hengchang Petrochemical has selected Spheripol polypropylene (PP) technology from LyondellBasell for implementation at a plant in Heze City, Shandong Province, China.

The plant will be capable of producing 200,000mt of PP per year.

Grades of PP produced using the Spheripol process are often used to make film for the safe storage of food and plastic pipes for the delivery of drinking water, as well as wastewater removal and sterile syringes in the healthcare sector.



LyondellBasell global manufacturing, refining, projects and technology executive vice-president Dan Coombs said: “The Spheripol process is recognised globally as the benchmark in polypropylene process technology.

"LyondellBasell is the global leader in polyolefins technology and we value the company‘s long-term commitment to its clients, continuously investing in its technologies."

“It provides our customers with an elegant and economical method to efficiently and reliably produce a wide range of premium-quality polypropylene grades. “

The new technology includes numerous process improvements that are intended to further increase operational efficiency.

It also supports the production of a number of homopolymers, random copolymers, heterophasic and specialty impact copolymers, in addition to terpolymers.

PP products produced by Spheripol are thin-walled and commonly used for light and rigid packaging items, packaging containers that preserve food and polypropylene pipes for the safe transportation of water.

Dongming Hengchang Petrochemical Company Strategic Planning and Engineering general manager Zhang Juchao said: “LyondellBasell is the global leader in polyolefins technology and we value the company‘s long-term commitment to its clients, continuously investing in its technologies.”

LyondellBasell’s Spheripol PP process technology has more than 22 million tonnes (Mt) of licensed capacity.
