Event

The Iraqi parliament voted on 28 May to cancel the results of election votes cast by (mainly Sunni) expatriates and internally displaced people from Anbar, Diyala, Ninewa, and Salaheddin.

On 21 May, the Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) had rejected ballots from 103 stations from these provinces, and from Baghdad and Erbil due to technical irregularities. The parliament also called for a manual recount of 10% of votes and for members of the IHEC to resign. The parliamentary session lacked a quorum and the validity of the resolution has been disputed. The three top-performing electoral coalitions in the 12 May elections are currently working to form majority coalitions in order to form a cabinet.
