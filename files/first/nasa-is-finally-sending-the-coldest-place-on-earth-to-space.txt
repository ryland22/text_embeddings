To figure out the fundamental mysteries of the universe, sometimes you have to make things really damn cold. NASA’s Cold Atom Laboratory takes this to the extreme by creating the coldest place in the universe. On Sunday, that laboratory is finally heading into space to study what happens when atoms get really, really frigid.

NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has spent the last few years building a chamber to cool a handful of atoms down to a billionth of a degree above absolute zero. At that scale, cooling stuff down is less about air conditioning and more about eliminating as much movement as possible.

The Cold Atom Laboratory uses a high-grade vacuum chamber and a series of powerful lasers, but that is not enough. To go further, researchers also need to eliminate gravity. This means sending the apparatus to space, so this Sunday a rocket traveling to the International Space Station will bring the Cold Atom Laboratory along for the ride.

Once there, the CAL will begin experimenting on Bose-Einstein condensates, exotic forms of matter that appear only at extremely cold temperatures. On Earth these condensates can exist for up to a second at a time before they collapse, but in space they can exist for ten seconds or more. This will give scientists a better opportunity to study them and see how they work.

Learning more about Bose-Einstein condensates can help us understand the weird nature of quantum mechanics, and this experiment is our best chance to do that.
