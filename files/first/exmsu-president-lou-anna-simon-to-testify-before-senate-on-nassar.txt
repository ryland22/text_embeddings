WASHINGTON – Former Michigan State University president Lou Anna Simon will testify before a U.S. Senate subcommittee next week in the wake of the scandal involving disgraced sports medicine physician Larry Nassar.

It is expected to be Simon's first public comments since Nassar — a former employee at the university who was accused of molesting more than a hundred girls and young women through his role as a doctor for USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee — was sentenced.

Simon stepped down Jan. 24 amid outrage over Nassar's case and accusations that MSU did not adequately respond to warnings and allegations made against him sooner. At the time, Simon said that while there was no cover-up at the university, "As tragedies are politicized, blame is inevitable."

She is set to testify next Tuesday before the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance and Data Security, which has been investigating whether Olympic athletes have been preyed upon by sexual predators and what is being done to ensure athletes are safe in the future.

The hearing is set to begin at 3 p.m. in Washington and will include testimony from Rhonda Faehn, the former women's program director at USA Gymnastics, and Steve Penny, the former president of USA Gymnastics.

Last month, at another hearing, Olympic gold medal gymnast Jordyn Wieber, a Lansing-area native, described for the subcommittee how she was abused by Nassar beginning at age 14, saying she believed that if she raised concerns at the time it might have hurt her future goals.

This month, Michigan State settled claims made by 332 people, agreeing to pay $500 million.
