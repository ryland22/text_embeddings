Japanese company Mitsui Chemicals has unveiled plans to establish a new facility in the US for the production of a soft resin known as Milastomer thermoplastic olefin elastomer.

The new plant will be capable of producing 6,000t of Milastomer per annum and will be set-up at the Ohio-plant of Mitsui Chemicals’ US subsidiary Advanced Composites.

The main ingredients used to produce Milastomer thermoplastic olefin elastomer, include olefin rubber and olefin resin.



Due to its low-density, lightweight and better moldability, the soft resin will be marketed by Mitsui Chemicals as an alternative to vinyl chloride and vulcanised rubber.

Milastomer is used to produce a number of items such as auto parts, building gaskets, toothbrushes, and golf club grips.

“The soft resin will be marketed by Mitsui Chemicals as an alternative to vinyl chloride and vulcanised rubber.”

Additionally, it can be used for other applications such as automotive interior covers, weather strips, airbag covers and steering bellows.

Construction on the new plant is expected to start in January next year and is slated for completion in June the same year. Production will commence after that in October 2019.

The new factory in the US will help the company to meet growing demand in North America and will serve as the company’s fourth production base worldwide.

Mitsui Chemicals America will sell Milastomer in North America, while Advanced Composites will handle production.

At present, Mitsui Chemicals owns production facilities in Japan, Europe, and China. Advanced Composites has plants in Ohio and Tennessee.
