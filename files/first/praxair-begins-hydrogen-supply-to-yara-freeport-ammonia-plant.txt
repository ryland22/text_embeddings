US-based natural gas company Praxair has started supplying hydrogen and nitrogen to Yara Freeport, an ammonia plant in Freeport, Texas.

The plant is a joint venture between Yara International and BASF and has an annual capacity of 750,000mt.

Under the agreement, Praxair will supply around 170 million standard cubic feet of hydrogen and 2,000t of nitrogen a day to the plant.



Praxair Global Hydrogen operations president Dan Yankowski said: “Praxair, Yara and BASF have worked diligently over the past three years to bring this important project to fruition.

“This project, supported by our extensive network of supply systems and pipelines in conjunction with our innovative technologies, provides Yara Freeport with the supply reliability they require to run this world-class ammonia plant efficiently.”

“This project provides Yara Freeport with the supply reliability they require to run this ammonia plant efficiently.”

In order to support the project, the company invested more than $400m to add hydrogen and nitrogen production capacity, in addition to extending its Gulf Coast pipeline systems nearly 50 miles from Texas City to the Freeport area.

In January this year, the company increased the amount of hydrogen supplies to Motiva Enterprises’ 600,000bpd refinery in Port Arthur, Texas.

In 2016, Motiva completed a hydrocracker and diesel hydrotreater capacity expansion, and the agreement secured the additional hydrogen needed to support the expansion, as well as the refinery’s ongoing needs.

At present, Praxair operates more than 50 hydrogen production facilities and seven hydrogen pipeline systems worldwide.

The company produces, sells and distributes atmospheric, process and specialty gases, and high-performance surface coatings.
