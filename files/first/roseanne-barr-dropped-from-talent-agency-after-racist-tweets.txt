Roseanne Barr was dropped from her talent agency, ICM Partners, following a series of racist, anti-Semitic tweets she posted on Tuesday.

“We are all greatly distressed by the disgraceful and unacceptable tweet from Roseanne Barr this morning,” the agency’s leadership said in an internal memo, Deadline reported.

“What she wrote is antithetical to our core values, both as individuals and as an agency. Consequently, we have notified her that we will not represent her. Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.”

Barr, 65, compared former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to an ape on Twitter Tuesday, which sparked outrage and led many to plead with ABC to act.

The network announced the series — which was ABC’s highest-rated and most-watched series — was canceled hours later.

“Roseanne’s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values and we have decided to cancel her show,” ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said in a statement.

“Roseanne” originally aired from 1988 to 1997 but was brought back in March to rave reviews and ratings. Barr reprised her role as brash matriarch Roseanne Conner, an unabashed Trump supporter who’s at political odds with the rest of her family.

Its hour-long debut picked up a record 18.1 million viewers.
