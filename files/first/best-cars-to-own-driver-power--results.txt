It’s that time of the year again where we reveal the best cars to own, as voted by you, our readers.

Last year, we completely overhauled Driver Power with a bigger, more comprehensive survey. We’ve kept the same format for 2018, asking owners to rate their motors across 31 subject areas in nine different categories. We’ve covered everything from small city cars to large premium SUVs.

Drivers with models less than 12 months old were quizzed on all aspects of ownership, from how well their vehicles accelerate and steer, whether there are enough storage compartments and sufficient boot space inside, and if they think their infotainment system is performing as they expected. We also asked drivers if they had experienced any issues with their cars in the past 12 months, and if so, what these problems were.

As you’ll note from the small margins separating many of the cars this year, the competition was tough among the various brands. But as always, there can be only one winner.

Below you'll find the full results of the 2018 Driver Power new car survey with details of how the new ratings work, an interactive table and full details on the top 75 best cars to own. Click on to page two for the best cars to own in each market segment from city cars to SUVs...

A. This number signifies the car’s position in the Driver Power Top 75. If your model isn’t here, we didn’t get enough responses to include it.

B. Here you can see at a glance how long the car has been in production for. Below this are key attributes that owners say shaped its performance.

C. We average a car’s scores across our nine judging categories to work out this percentage. This is its overall rating, and defines its chart position.

D. These bars represent individual rankings in each of our Driver Power judging categories. The longer the bar, the better the car performed.

E. Once again in 2018, we asked owners to report any faults with their car. This is the percentage who did, plus we spell out what the most common problems were.

F. In addition, we’ve picked out some interesting comments – good and bad – from owners of each model.

Driver Power 2018: The top 10 best cars to own

1. Peugeot 3008 – 93.88%

Key points: Strong scores in every area are key to breakthrough victory for French SUV.

Image 2 of 20 Image 2 of 20

Britain’s best car to own is the Peugeot 3008 – by a convincing margin. It wins Driver Power by performing well in pretty much every area, and, significantly, doing nothing badly.

Owners tell us they think it looks fantastic for one thing, with the French SUV topping the exterior design and build quality category – an impressive result, and one that shows the 3008 name is now attached to a far more desirable car than its MPV predecessor.

Peugeot’s upmarket aspirations are underlined by a superb mark for interior quality, while the 3008 is practical, too, with excellent finishes for seat flexibility, boot space and storage. The tech on offer is competitive, if not class leading, and great safety features reflect its five-star Euro NCAP rating.

Owners love driving the Peugeot, too, with the small, sporty wheel being key to an impressive score for steering responsiveness. Ride quality, braking effectiveness and overall driving pleasure – something family SUVs sometimes miss out on – were also highly rated. Factor in decent rankings for reliability and running costs, and the 3008 is a worthy winner.

Has it ever gone wrong?

Yes: 11.0%

Electrics will most probably be to blame if the 3008 experiences any problems.

Living with a Peugeot 3008

Nikki Young, chair of Mutual Support, the armed forces’ multiple sclerosis charity, owns a Peugeot 3008 GT Line, and has nothing but praise for it.

She told us: “It’s just fantastic – the best car I’ve ever owned. I’ve covered 13,000 miles in six months, and it’s so smooth. The power is there when I want it, and the auto box is responsive.”

What convinced her to go for the 3008 over rivals? “I looked at the Volkswagen Tiguan and Nissan Qashqai, but the 3008’s interior, powertrain and styling swayed me,” explained Nikki, from Yaxley, Suffolk. “It’s the bee’s knees; I love my 3008 and keep it spotless.”

So the Peugeot is good to drive and looks great, but it’s also easy to live with. Nikki added: “The driving position is cosseting, there are plenty of storage places and space in the rear is excellent.”

It’s held up to daily life, too. “I was dubious about the fabric on the dash, but it’s been durable. Nothing has broken – and I’m good at snapping things!” Nikki said. “Plus, I return 55mpg, despite carrying a 95kg wheelchair and hoist in the boot.”

Your view

“Manual box is spot on with good spacing between gears, well-judged gaiting and smooth action.”

“Dashboard design is unique and stands head and shoulders above other cars, regardless of price or perceived quality.”

2. Kia Niro – 93.07%

Key points: Hybrid newcomer is our infotainment king, with gearbox the main bugbear.

Image 3 of 20 Image 3 of 20

It’s an outstanding debut for the Niro, which is named the most satisfying small SUV to own and comes second overall. Owners love the infotainment in particular; it is ranked first for user-friendliness and its stereo, and second for the responsiveness of its touchscreen.

The cabin also fares well, with an excellent fourth-place finish in this area. Owners tell us the Niro’s front seats are comfortable, its rear seats are spacious, while overall quality also impressed. It tops the table for front-seat visibility as well, and posts a strong fourth-place result for overall interior fit and finish. The safety features are highly praised, plus owners say the car is satisfying to drive, with a particularly comfortable ride. While seating flexibility was felt to be good, buyers would like a bigger boot than the 427 litres on offer.

Your only other real criticism is directed towards the Niro’s petrol-electric drivetrain. Owners say the acceleration on offer from the Niro’s 104bhp 1.6-litre petrol engine and 43bhp electric motor leaves them wanting more, while the hybrid’s six-speed dual-clutch gearbox garnered only a middle-of-the-table result for the smoothness it offers.

Has it ever gone wrong?

Yes: 11.7%

Issues with the transmission are most likely among the Niro drivers who experience gremlins.

Living with a Kia Niro

Evaline Foster, a retired café owner from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, hadn’t intended to buy a Niro, but was glad she did. “We were looking for a Skoda Yeti, but as this was going out of production the dealer didn’t have the model we were after,” she told us. “When I saw the Niro, I just thought it looked great.”

The positive impressions continued when Evaline drove it. She added: “It really impressed me; it was so easy to drive. The auto lights and wipers, reversing camera and sat-nav made it very straightforward.

“It’s very smooth: you can hardly tell when it’s switching from electric to petrol drive. I also get great economy. We mainly use it for town driving, but even on a trip to the local supermarket we get around 48mpg.”

And the Niro’s SUV stance has proven a bonus. Evaline explained: “The height is also a real help: my husband has mobility problems, and being a bit taller than a standard car means getting in and out of the Niro is easy.”

Your view

“One of the quietest cars I have owned. Smooth, soaks up bumps well and the controls are light.”

“I like the seven years’ free sat-nav map updates. The ability to wirelessly connect my smartphone for traffic and weather updates is also useful.”

3. Alfa Romeo Giulia – 93.06%

Key points: Giulia is a true Alfa and it’s top for performance. Reliability is a concern, though.

Image 4 of 20 Image 4 of 20

The Giulia spearheaded Alfa Romeo’s rebirth and hasn’t quite served up the expected sales yet. But those who have bought one tell us they love it.

A true Alfa should be great to look at and drive, and the Giulia delivers, with the 2.0-litre petrol, 2.2 diesel and 2.9 V6 petrol engines rated top for performance and third for refinement. The car is genuine fun to drive, with the steering ranked the best in the survey, and the brakes and ride quality picking up stellar scores.

Owners also say they love the way the Giulia looks, with a fantastic result for its design only slightly marred by a marginal ranking for exterior build quality. Still, with a number one rating for child safety features, the Giulia is clearly well suited to family life.

Fuel economy is a concern, with the Alfa scoring a below average result in this area, while the Italian saloon’s infotainment system is also said to be behind the competition; its sat-nav and infotainment display comes in for particular criticism.

Perhaps more worrying is the car’s reliability, because a very high proportion of owners tell us that they’ve experienced faults with their Giulia.

Has it ever gone wrong?

Yes: 40.3%

In its short time on sale, a high number of Giulia owners report faults – mainly with the electrics.

Living with an Alfa Romeo Giulia

“The Giulia is the most astonishing car,” John Vater QC, a barrister from Oxfordshire, told us. He owns the hot 503bhp Quadrifoglio (QV) model, but John reckons elements of the Italian performance saloon will be appreciated by all Giulia owners.

“It has an unbelievably good driving position and, with the exception of my Porsche 911, the best steering of any car I have ever driven,” John said. “When you drive over white lines on the road, you can feel it through your fingertips.”

John’s experience with powerful cars puts him in a good position to judge the Giulia’s relative merits. “Having owned a BMW M3 and a Mercedes-AMG C 63, I think the quality of the Giulia’s interior more than matches them,” he explained. “I actually think there’s more rear legroom in the Alfa, and I prefer it on long journeys to the BMW and Mercedes.”

Unlike some Giulia owners, John hasn’t suffered any reliability issues, either, adding: “I drive the car pretty hard and have had no problems whatsoever.”

Your view

“Best-looking executive saloon on sale. Outshines German brands. Only the Jaguar XE comes close.”

“Steering is one of Giulia’s best aspects. Better than any other car I’ve driven and on par with my colleague’s Porsche Cayman in the real world.”

4. Toyota Prius – 93.04%

Key points: Hybrid trendsetter is our fuel economy champ and has few weak points.

Image 5 of 20 Image 5 of 20

The world’s most famous hybrid vehicle continues to delight its many owners as an exceptional all-rounder.

The Toyota Prius scores strongly in a number of categories, and came top for the impressive economy it delivers – not unsurprising given this is part of the car’s reason for being, but reassuring all the same.

As well as low running costs, the hybrid Toyota is characterised by its excellent reliability and build quality, with superb results in these areas. And while efficiency may be core to the Prius ethos, owners tell us they rate the overall driving experience; but the ride quality came in for some criticism. Still, the Prius got excellent scores for the petrol-electric drivetrain it has been fundamental in popularising, and Toyota’s Safety Sense suite of protective systems helped the hatchback scoop the bronze medal in the safety feature category.

Areas to look out for on the car? There aren’t many. The 502-litre boot attracted some criticism from readers, plus they say cabin storage could be better. The Prius’s infotainment system could also do with some tweaks, according to owners, with the sat-nav in particular getting a mediocre score.

Has it ever gone wrong?

Yes: 6.1%

Not many faults, but if Prius does go wrong, the most likely culprit is the paint or exterior trim.

Living with a Toyota Prius

“The Prius was a complete change for me as my previous car was a Mazda MX-5,” explained Ross Bennet, a financial advisor from Aylestone, Leicester – although he’d toyed with the idea of one before.

“I’d test driven the previous Prius and loved the hybrid set-up, but I didn’t like the looks,” he told us. “I like this one, though; it’s much more angular.”

Ross’s decision to buy was driven by his head rather than his heart. He explained: “I couldn’t argue with the numbers. I was spending £200 a month on petrol for my MX-5, but in the Prius I spend around £50. It’s ridiculous how little fuel I’m putting in it.”

But the Prius has also made Ross calmer behind the wheel. “It really encourages relaxed driving,” he told us. “You don’t mind being stuck in traffic thanks to EV mode; you just glide along in silence, happy in the knowledge you’re not using any fuel.”

The biggest endorsement is that he isn’t yearning for an MX-5. “I’m probably going to get another Prius after this one,” he said. “It’s converted me to hybrids.”

Your view

“CVT gives smooth acceleration with no kickdown and instant power, so it’s quick off the line.”

“The fuel economy in town and on motorways is unbelievable. I achieve 70mpg and the number of visits I make to petrol stations has halved.”

5. Lexus RX – 92.99%

Key points: Large luxury SUV gets it right in most areas, marred only by fuel economy.

Image 6 of 20 Image 6 of 20

Finishing one place above Lexus’s smaller SUV, the NX, is its big brother, the RX. Once again, owners love the luxurious ambience of the cabin, where the styling, fit, finish and comfort attract superb feedback. The RX’s front seats also come in for lots of praise, with owners telling us they provide impressive support for the driver and passenger.

Given the size of the car, it’s no surprise that drivers rate practicality highly as well, while the Lexus achieves a strong fourth-place finish for infotainment and connectivity thanks, in part, to a ranking of second for the high-end stereo system and the smartphone interface.

The RX’s ride and handling score is pegged back by an average rating for driving pleasure, but there are no issues with the petrol and hybrid engines; satisfaction with the performance is rated behind only the Alfa Giulia, while refinement also gets a stellar score.

Running costs is the only area where it struggles to convince: its result in this area is reasonable, but fuel economy was rated pretty poorly, suggesting owners are struggling to match the RX’s official 53.3mpg figure.

Has it ever gone wrong?

Yes: 19.3%

Surprisingly high number of RX owners encounter problems, and most blame the interior trim.

Living with a Lexus RX

Perminder Sahota, an IT consultant from Hounslow, Middlesex, is very clear why he chose a Lexus RX. “The car’s size, the shape, the comfort and Lexus’s reputation for reliability all drew me to it,” he said. “I looked at the Jaguar F-Pace, but the RX felt better built and had more space in the back.”

And Perminder needs the RX’s rear-seat capacity. “Both my sons are over six feet tall, but they can sit anywhere in the RX with plenty of room, even compared with other cars in the class,” he added.

Lexus’s famous attention to detail is clear to see inside as well. Perminder continued: “The quality is immediately obvious, and there are several small details I like. The stitching on the leather, the hidden storage cubby under the wrist rest, the slats in the boot to stop things rolling about – all this makes the RX feel like a well thought through car.”

Add a comfortable driving experience – “it just floats over bumps” – and it’s clear that, for Perminder, the Lexus has all the hallmarks of a true luxury car.

Your view

“RX is well rounded. It’s powerful, fast and easy to drive, yet offers good economy for a car of its size.”

“It oozes quality. With the current RX, Lexus has taken an already good car and carried out small enhancements to make it even better.”

6. Lexus NX – 92.90%

Key points: Futuristic model is rated the best-built car in Driver Power.

Image 7 of 20 Image 7 of 20

Owners say there’s no better-built car. The NX topped our quality ratings, and impressed elsewhere, too. The futuristic styling is highly praised, as is the comfortable and beautifully finished cabin. Buyers are happy on the road, too, with strong results for ride, handling and drive.

However, two categories stop it finishing even higher. It’s not the cheapest SUV to run, with economy ranked a disappointing 61st. And the infotainment doesn’t score too well, with Lexus’s touchpad system an apparent bugbear.

Has it ever gone wrong?

Yes: 6.6%

Impressive reliability sees few faults reported. Braking issues are most common.

Your view

“Great style; an unusual design and very distinctive. I often get compliments from passers by.”

“I love the small details: the leather on the dash, the contrasting stitching and the aluminium switches make all the difference.”

7. Kia Sorento – 92.85%

Key points: Satisfaction is almost guaranteed with this practical seven-seater SUV.

Image 8 of 20 Image 8 of 20

Here’s proof you needn’t shell out on a premium brand to get a hugely satisfying SUV. Owners find the Kia Sorento seven-seater super-practical, and it tops our rankings for flexibility, boot and storage. Quality and reliability are rated very highly, although there are a significant number of reported problems.

The tech is decent and easy to use, and owners are pleased with the drive, too, although there is a fair amount of noise from the diesel engine. One bone of contention is the claimed 49.6mpg, which receives a below-average rating.

Has it ever gone wrong?

Yes: 23.5%

Nearly a quarter of Sorento owners tell us of problems, with the electrics mainly to blame.

Your view

“I don’t expect the Sorento to be razor sharp; I want a comfortable, safe drive – which is what I get.”

“A competent mile-eater on the motorway, and it handles light off-road duties equally well. It remains poised in all conditions.”

8. Toyota Verso – 92.83%

Key points: A great ranking from family owners belies MPV’s advancing years.

Image 9 of 20 Image 9 of 20

It’s easy to forget about the Verso MPV, as it’s been on sale for nearly a decade, but it’s still providing sterling service to family owners. Owners are lavish in their praise of its seat flexibility, boot, storage and child-friendliness.

No car gets a higher rating for reliability, the safety kit attracts praise and even the drive is given the thumbs-up. There appear to be very few drawbacks to ownership. Gearboxes achieve only an average score, as does the touchscreen, but overall this is an excellent performance.

Has it ever gone wrong?

Yes: 13.7%

Transmission problems are most likely if the Verso suffers a fault.

Your view

“Autonomous braking helped me when someone pulled out in front of me. It reacted quicker than me.”

“I’m short of stature, so visibility can sometimes be a problem – but the Verso is one of the best cars I’ve ever owned for all-round visibility.”

9. Honda Civic – 92.50%

Key points: Latest Civic blasts into Driver Power with a cost-effective ownership experience.

Image 10 of 20 Image 10 of 20

The new Civic makes an impressive Driver Power debut. Drivers are delighted with many elements of ownership – mainly with how cost-effective the car is to run. And the highlight is the top satisfaction score in the survey for servicing bills.

The nicely laid-out cabin is also a winner, with child-friendliness rating well. Tech is a mixed bag – the sat-nav is ranked highest, but infotainment responsiveness is seen as only average. The drive is competent, not thrilling. Engine refinement is a strength; braking performance a weakness.

Has it ever gone wrong?

Yes: 9.3%

Nearly one in 10 owners report issues, generally with the electrics

Your view

“Brilliant engine. The 1.0-litre three-cylinder is the most versatile unit I’ve come across.”

“The Type R’s handling is great, while fixed-price servicing is no more expensive than it is for a standard Civic.”

10. Skoda Octavia – 92.45%

Key points: Classic strong performance from Skoda, which ranks highly for cabin and drive.

Image 11 of 20 Image 11 of 20

The Octavia delivers everywhere you’d expect a Skoda to. Buyers are pleased with its practicality; the boot picks up the second highest satisfaction score, and storage and seat flexibility are strong, even if child-friendliness is marked down. Comfort, rear space and front visibility are highly rated, too.

Owners are happy with the engine and box, and say the Octavia steers, brakes and handles well, yet they’re less satisfied with the ride. Quality and reliability are plus points, but a little more visual flair would be appreciated.

Has it ever gone wrong?

Yes: 7.3%

Transmission woes are cited as the likely issues if the Octavia has problems.

Your view

“Fit and finish is as good as I’d expect in an upmarket model, let alone an affordable car like this.”

“It’s a family hatchback, not a go-kart, but it handles better than I expected. It’s also so spacious; it’s like a Tardis inside.”
