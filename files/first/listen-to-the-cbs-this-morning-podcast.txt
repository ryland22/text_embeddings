Latest "CBS This Morning" Podcast original:

How Twitter has Destroyed Comedy



Only on the "CBS This Morning" podcast, author Ken Jennings joins CBS News correspondent Tony Dokoupil to discuss his new book on the history of comedy, "Planet Funny: How Comedy Took Over Our Culture." Prompted to write the book because of his experience on Twitter, Jennings makes the argument that comedy has been weaponized and has lead to the lost of earnestness and sincerity in society. Jennings, who gamed fame for having the longest winning streak on the TV game show Jeopardy!, claims there is too much humor today and comedy has become the lens through which we see the world. The two discuss why we laugh, the difference between comedy and humor and if there is such a thing as a timeless joke.
