Eminem‘s most embarrassing moments include the time Val Kilmer allegedly caught him in his birthday suit.

Recounting the memory Monday night on Twitter, the 45-year-old rapper said the encounter happened during an MTV awards show around 2009 or 2010.

“I have something on my mind that’s been bothering me for years and I will tell you a little story,” Eminem began. “I was at the VMAs — it was either Music Awards, Movie Awards, something. My trailer was next door to 50 [Cent]’s trailer and I went to the back to go change for stage, and as I’m taking off my underwear, I look across at 50’s trailer, right even with me, is Val Kilmer.”

As the awkward seconds ticked away, Eminem recalled Kilmer, 58, soon looking away.

“I know he’s looking at me, and I know he looked away because he saw me looking at him,” Eminem said. “I know Val Kilmer saw me naked. I just had to get that off my chest.”

Following his confession, Kilmer later exposed his side of the story.

“I was nxt to Eminem’s trailer as a guest of 50, but sadly they only thing I saw was 50 closing Shady’s door after they had a visit!” Kilmer tweeted Tuesday. “There’s a joke in there somewhere.”
