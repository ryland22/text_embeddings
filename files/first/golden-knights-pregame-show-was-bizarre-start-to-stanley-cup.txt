You only get one first Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals.

The Vegas Golden Knights made sure they left an impression with theirs, however excessive it may have been.

Before their players went out and beat the Capitals in a wild 6-4 game Monday night, the team put on its own show pregame, a Game of Thrones-esque ceremony. It included a narrator describing how the west was won, a golden knight on skates taking out a group of skaters with red capes representing the Capitals and even a catapult launching CGI cannon balls at the opponents.

“The Golden Knights army has vanquished the Kings, feasted on Sharks and grounded the Jets,” the narrator began, referring to the teams Vegas beat to get to the Stanley Cup finals. “Conquering enemies on land, sea and air, the West belongs to Vegas.”

The extravaganza was capped off by boxing announcer Michael Buffer introducing the starting lineups. And yes, he did tell the crowd to “get ready to rumble.”

Also in Sin City Monday, Lil Jon performed outside of T-Mobile Arena before the game to get the crowd even more riled up.

The expansion team has not been afraid to go crazy for their pregame shows, especially during the playoffs, with Monday’s just the most elaborate one yet. Just imagine if there’s a Game 7.
