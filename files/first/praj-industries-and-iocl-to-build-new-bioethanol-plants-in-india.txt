Praj Industries has signed a binding agreement for cost sharing with Indian Oil (IOCL) to establish two new second-generation (2G) bio-ethanol plants in Haryana and Gujarat, India.

Once completed, the new plants will be capable of producing 100,000l of ethanol a day.

In September, IOCL selected Praj as its technology partner to establish various 2G bio-ethanol plants based on its indigenously developed technology.



Under the deal, Praj will also provide plant machinery and help IOCL to operate and maintain the facilities.

It has been reported that 2G bio-ethanol technology uses ligno-cellulosic biomass or agri-residue as feedstock, helping the farming community to earn more revenues from agri-waste.

The bio-ethanol also helps reduce dependency on imported crude oil.

Praj Industries executive chairman Pramod Chaudhari said: “We are pleased with the progress of setting up of 2G ethanol projects by the OMCs.

"Praj is equally committed to partner with OMCs in their achievement of completing project targets."

“Praj is equally committed to partner with OMCs in their achievement of completing project targets.

“This is in line with the Government of India’s vision of increased contribution of renewables in India’s energy portfolio.”

Furthermore, India’s Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) has selected Praj as a technology partner to set up a 2G bio-ethanol plant in Orissa.

Praj currently provides solutions to bio-ethanol facilities and brewery plants, as well as water and wastewater treatment systems.
