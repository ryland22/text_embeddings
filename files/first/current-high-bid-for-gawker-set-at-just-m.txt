Gawker took its first tentative steps toward being revived when...

The gossip website Gawker​ ​– which was worth an estimated $100 million before ​former pro-​wrestler Hulk Hogan won a $140 million verdict against the company for publishing his unauthorized sex tape​ ​– will be sold to a digital ad company for just $1.13 million if other buyers ​don’t come forward by mid-July.

New York-based marketing firm Didit has offered to purchase the shuttered site out of bankruptcy and transform the once-snarky blog into a force for “Good Gossip” and “Good News,” according to a press release.

Other potential buyers would have to offer at least $1.3 million at a July 12 auction to surpass Didit’s bid, according to bankruptcy filings.

Univision bought the sister websites of Gawker.com for $135 million in 2017– but the media giant didn’t want the gossip site because it was considered too toxic.

Experts had expected the sale of Gawker.com to bring in at least $5 million. The site was valued at $100 million prior to the Hogan verdict.

Forty-five percent of any sale proceeds will go to Hogan and the other 55 percent to equity owners, including founder Nick Denton.
