Raytheon is to develop a new mine neutraliser vehicle to fulfil the US Navy’s (USN’s) requirement for an expendable ‘one-shot’ device able to identify and destroy bottom, near surface, and drifting mines.

The system, to be known as Barracuda, will be initially deployed from the Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Unmanned Surface Vehicle (MCM USV) forming part of the Littoral Combat Ship MCM mission package.

Raytheon’s Integrated Defense Systems was awarded a USD83.3 million contract by Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) in mid-April for the design, test, and deployment of the Barracuda mine neutralisation system. The contract includes options which, if exercised, will bring the value of the contract up to USD362.7 million.
