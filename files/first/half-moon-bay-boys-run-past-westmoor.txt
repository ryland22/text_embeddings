Half Moon Bay 65, Westmoor 50

Rumblings could be heard all the way up and down the Peninsula. A rocky start to the season had fans wondering if this was the year Half Moon Bay would be knocked off its pedestal high atop the PAL North.

Since league play started, Half Moon Bay has silenced all doubters, and the Cougars continued to do so on Wednesday night with a convincing 65-50 win over second place Westmoor. Three scorers finished the night in double figures for a Half Moon Bay team that outrebounded visiting Westmoor 39-14.

Trailing 14-12 after a quarter, Half Moon Bay (9-6, 4-0) outscored Westmoor 44-22 over the middle two periods of the game and cruised to the finish. Westmoor (11-5, 3-1) closed the first quarter on a 12-1 run, but Half Moon Bay adapted to the Rams’ full court press. Senior guard Andrew Saffold took the floor in the second quarter repeatedly beat the Westmoor press. Saffold shared the team lead with 14 points, seven of which came in the second quarter.

Westmoor hung around for a while thanks to the efforts of sophomore guard Marquez Costiniano (nine points) and senior forward Sean Orr, who led all scorers with 16 points. Half Moon Bay pulled away in the third thanks to senior guard Isiah Margate, who finished with 14 points. Margate, who became eligible to play in January after transferring from Oceana, has filled a significant role in Half Moon Bay’s lineup with his ability to drive to the hoop. The third piece of HMB’s guard trio, Sam Treanor, scored five in a third quarter where the Cougars outscored Westmoor 22-12. Treanor finished with 12 points.

On the glass, 6-6 junior Ethan Menzies led the Half Moon Bay barrage with 11 rebounds. Dating back to 2014, the Cougars have won 39 of 40 PAL North games. The one blemish was a 2015 defeat to rival Terra Nova, which will host Half Moon Bay on Friday night in Pacifica.

Crosstown rival Jefferson (9-7, 3-1) will host Westmoor on Friday night. Jefferson picked up an 88-61 win on Wednesday at Oceana.
