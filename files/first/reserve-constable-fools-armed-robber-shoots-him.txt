Reserve constable fools armed robber, shoots him

BAKER- Authorities say a reserve constable shot an armed man who robbed him early Monday.

The shooting happened on Alba Drive before 3 a.m.

According to Police Chief Carl Dunn, the victim was working on a house he's been building when a man with a handgun rode up to him on a bicycle.

The armed robber forced the victim go to an ATM to get cash, but Dunn said the robber was not satisfied with the amount of money he got.

The victim then told the robber he had another ATM card at his house in Baker. They went to the house and the robber allowed the man inside to get the supposed second card. But, the robber got antsy while waiting and went into the house. Police say the victim had his own gun inside the home and shot the robber once as he walked inside.

Dunn said the victim showed quick thinking and restraint.

"This guy to me is a hero," Dunn said.

He kept a cool head under pressure, protected himself and then stopped firing when the threat was removed, Dunn said.

When the attacker dropped his gun, the victim stopped firing, Dunn said.

The robbery suspect has been identified as 22-year-old Jaylan Franklin. He is charged with aggravated kidnapping and armed robbery by the EBRSO. He is also charged with aggravated burglary, resisting, and bench warrants from Zachary by the Baker Police.
