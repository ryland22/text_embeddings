State-owned energy and petrochemical firm Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with The Linde Group to explore the expansion of nitrogen facilities at Ruwais in Abu Dhabi, UAE.

The MoU builds on the joint business development commitment by the two parties that led to the formation of the joint venture Adnoc Industrial Gases ten years ago.

In the initial stage, Linde will conduct a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study for the new Air Separation Units, which are expected to meet the expanding nitrogen requirements of ADNOC’s gas processing, petrochemicals, and refining businesses.



Subsequent steps will follow as the two companies grow together to satisfy the growing demand for industrial gases from ADNOC’s downstream businesses.

ADNOC Downstream director Al Hajri said: “In line with its 2030 smart growth strategy, ADNOC plans to expand and diversify its downstream refining and petrochemicals activities, while also optimising efficiency and costs.

“The Ruwais Air Separation Unit Project will be carried out in two phases, each with the capacity to produce 70,000m³ per hour of nitrogen.”

“As part of our strategic plan to increase volumes of industrial gases, the Ruwais Air Separation Unit Project will be carried out in two phases, each with the capacity to produce 70,000m³ per hour of nitrogen.”

ADNOC Industrial Gases specialises in producing gaseous nitrogen, liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen for its sites in Abu Dhabi.

It was formed in 2007 as a joint venture between ADNOC and Linde. ADNOC has a 51% interest in the JV, while Linde holds the remaining stake.

Initially, the company was named ‘Elixier’ and its first plant, called ELIXIER I, being commissioned in 2009.

The company’s name was changed with the launch of ADNOC’s unified brand last month.
