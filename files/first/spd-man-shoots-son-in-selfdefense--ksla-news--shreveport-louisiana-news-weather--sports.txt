Shreveport police are investigating after a man reportedly shot his son in the leg behind a clinic Tuesday morning.

It happened just before 8 a.m. in the parking lot behind the Specialists Health System in 1500 block of Line Avenue.

According to a Shreveport detective on scene, 71-year-old Felton Downing and his son 42-year-old Duawn Downing were having a dispute in the parking lot when Duawn charged towards his dad.

Investigators say Duawn made verbal threats to kill his father while strangling him.

That's when Felton says he tried to fire a warning shot in self-defense and ended up shooting his son in the leg.

Duawn, who police say reportedly has a history of mental illness, was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

Felton Downing had minor injuries to his neck and throat following the attack.

The father was taken to the Shreveport Police Complex for questioning but was later released and is not facing charges at this time.

The investigation is ongoing.
