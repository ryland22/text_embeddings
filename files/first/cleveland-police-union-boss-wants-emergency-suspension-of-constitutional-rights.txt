USA – -(Ammoland.com)- The Cleveland Police union boss has made an emergency request to suspend open carry for the duration of the Republican convention inside parts of the City of Cleveland.

“We are sending a letter to Gov. Kasich requesting assistance from him. He could very easily do some kind of executive order or something — I don’t care if it’s constitutional or not at this point,” Cleveland Police Union president Stephen Loomis told CNN.

Once more powers that be want to target honest gun owners, if the police union boss really does not care about our rights, why doesn't he want to suspend the right to free speech and shut down all the protesters.

If it is really about safety, why target law abiding gun owners, why not everyone. Bad people don't follow laws and anyone that wants to kill cops or shoot conservatives will not follow an order that suspend our rights and they will bring guns no matter what. This requests would only effect people that follow the law in the first place.

Ohio's open carry laws allow anyone without a felony record to carry guns in the state, including in downtown Cleveland, but not inside the U.S. Secret Service security zone around Quicken Loans Arena, where the RNC will be held Monday through Thursday.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich responded saying that Ohio governors don't have the power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state constitutional rights or laws.
