The governments of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will receive M1A2 Abrams tank hardware in a new U.S. government contract with ContiTech USA.

The deal was announced Wednesday by the Department of Defense.

More than $23.9 million will be obligated to ContiTech USA under the terms of a firm-fixed-price foreign military sale contract that will see the two countries receive "complete rolls of shoe track assemblies for the M1A2 Abrams battle tank.".

Work on the contract will occur in Fairlawn, Ohio, and is expected to be complete in April 2020, said the U.S. Army Contracting Command.

The total cumulative value of the contract will be obligated to ContiTech USA at time of award.

The obligated funds will be allocated from fiscal 2010 foreign military sales financial accounts, the Pentagon said.
