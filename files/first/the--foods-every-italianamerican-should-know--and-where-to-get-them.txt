Italian food is the most popular ethnic cuisine in the U.S., with 61 percent of Americans reporting they eat it regularly (the numbers are 50 percent for Mexican food and 36 percent for Chinese food).

So here's our list of 99 essential Italian-American foods, everything from affogato to zuppa di pesce. We'll even tell you where to find a great example of each.
