Summer Celebrations 2018— Our guide to the Chicago area’s festivals

Fans dance as Lil Yachty performs on day four of Lollapalooza in Grant Park, Sunday, Aug. 6, 2017. | Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times

The weather is warming up and in Chicago that signals the return of the summer festival season. While the big three of music — Lollapalooza, Pitchfork and Riot Fest — get a lot of attention, there are many others festivals that highlight Chicago’s diverse neighborhoods, arts and culture, food, music and other organizations. The annual city-sponsored festivals (gospel, blues, jazz, world music) take place in Millennium Park with the downtown skyline as a backdrop. And Taste of Chicago returns July 5 in Grant Park. Here’s a look at where to find summer fun in the city and suburbs.
