2016 Boat of the Year: Regal 29 OBX Tom King

It was telling that we could not find a comparison boat when producing the boat test for Regal’s 29 OBX. After all, Boating’s Boat of the Year is the boat that impresses more in its category than any other boat impresses in any other category. The 29 OBX exceeded almost every measure by which one might judge a bowrider or day boat. Check out our test to get the details for yourself. We just couldn’t find a directly comparable boat to suggest to you as an alternative if you were considering buying the 29 OBX.

What we did find was this boat meets or exceeds American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC) standards. Whether it’s to assess the safety provided by a grab rail or bow rail, determining the appropriate cockpit scupper size, examining the electrical system or conducting safe-turn tests, the ABYC standards inform each and every Boating boat test.

The 29 OBX is built rugged, and its finish is better than most. Its performance exceeded expectations, leveraging the best attributes of outboard power and Regal’s FasTrac hull. Boating’s Tech Team, with a combined 75 years of boat-testing experience (and almost a combined 200 years simply boating) is confident in making these statements, having tested more than 100 2016 model-year boats.

That there is no other bowrider this size with twin outboard power is just one reason we are proud to name the Regal 29 OBX Boating’s 2016 Boat of the Year.
