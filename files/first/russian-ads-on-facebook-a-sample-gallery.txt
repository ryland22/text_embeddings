"There's no question that Russia sought to weaponize social media platforms to drive a wedge between Americans, and in an attempt to sway the 2016 election," Rep. Adam Schiff, D.-California, said in statement, adding that the online campaign was an effort to divide Americans "by our race, by our country of origin, by our religion and by our political party."
