SeaStar Solutions has announced the introduction of its “next generation” SeaStar Jackplates. The improved Gen II SeaStar Standard and Xtreme Jackplates are easier to install and adjust and can better resist the damaging effects of the harsh marine environment.

The new Gen II SeaStar Jackplates are available in two models. The SeaStar Standard Jackplate is rated for outboards up to 300 horsepower and the new SeaStar Xtreme Jackplate for outboards up to 400 horsepower. Advanced composite bushings allow for smoother movement of the hydraulic rams when the jackplate is raised or lowered for superior performance at all speeds and loads. Both models are available with 4-, 6-, 8-, 10- and 12-inch setbacks. Thanks to redesigned engine brackets, shallow water anchors can now be mounted to all setbacks, from 4 inches to 12 inches, on both models without the use of adapter plates.

Redesigned engine brackets have also improved access to the mounting bolts. Side access has been introduced to make it easier to get a wrench on engine mounting bolts while clearance to access transom mounting bolts has also been opened up, making it easier for one person to install the plate on a boat.
