Specialty chemical manufacturer Lanxess has revealed plans to build a facility for prepolymers production at its site in Porto Feliz, Brazil.

Lanxess’s Urethane Systems business unit will make an investment on prepolymer production that is expected to be in the single-digit million euros, but the exact figure has not been disclosed.

The new facility is expected to become operational in the first half of next year.



Once the new facility becomes operational, the existing prepolymer production facility at the Rio Claro site will be terminated, and Lanxess will manage its entire polyurethane business for South America from Porto Feliz.

Urethane Systems business unit head Dr Markus Eckert said: “South America is an important cornerstone of our global network and we are committed to the Brazilian and South American markets.

“Our investment will enable us to sustainably offer local customer-specific technical service, excellent product quality, and fast and reliable product supply.”
