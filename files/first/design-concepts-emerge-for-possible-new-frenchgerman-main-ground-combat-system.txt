Key Points

France and Germany's potential joint MGCS is moving forward with four general concepts, including unmanned teaming variants

Production could start around 2033, but the project faces long odds

France and Germany have been working on the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) since 2012 to replace their currently deployed main battle tanks (MBTs), and details of the likely requirements are beginning to emerge through four design concepts.

In the French Army the MGCS would potentially replace the Nexter Systems Leclerc MBT, of which 400 were delivered and 200 remain in service. These Leclerc tanks are to be upgraded to extend their operational lives and will play a key role in the French Army SCORPION network enabled capability (NEC) that brings together a range of air and land platforms, industry sources told Janeâ€™s .
