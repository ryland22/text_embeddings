Attention, humans: your beds are dirtier than chimpanzees’, according to a new paper from North Carolina State University. Chimpanzees sleep on treetop beds which they make each night. Humans sleep in what is virtually their own home-ecosystem: “human beds often contain a subset of the taxa—or types—of organisms found in the home," says Megan Thoemmes, lead author of the study. "For example, about 35 percent of bacteria in human beds stem from our own bodies, including fecal, oral and skin bacteria. We wanted to know how this compares with some of our closest evolutionary relatives, the chimpanzees.”

Researchers in Tanzania tested swabs from 41 chimpanzee nests for microbial biodiversity. Chimp beds had a great diversity of microbes, but a lot less fecal, oral or skin bacteria. "We found almost none of those microbes in the chimpanzee nests, which was a little surprising," Thoemmes says. In addition, researchers vacuumed 15 nests to sample the insects and arachnids nearby. They found that the chimps’ homes had a surprisingly low number of parasites.

How did this happen? Are chimps really cleaner than humans? Maybe not: chimps build a new nest 30 feet off the ground to sleep every night, whereas we sleep in the same bed almost every night, accruing bacteria over time. Mattresses, pillows, and sheets also gather massive amounts of dust mites and dead skin over time.

“[Humans] have created sleeping places in which our exposure to soil and other environmental microbes has all but disappeared, and we are instead surrounded by less diverse microbes that are primarily sourced from our own bodies,” the study authors write. By trying to stay clean, we may have made our home environments more dirty, potentially even less healthy.
