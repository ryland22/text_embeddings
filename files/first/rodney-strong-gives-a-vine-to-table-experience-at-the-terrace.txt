As the first buds break, Sonoma County wineries spring to life with barrel tastings, special events and food-and-wine pairings. One “strong” case in point: The grand opening of The Terrace, the intimate outdoor patio at Rodney Strong Vineyards.

To celebrate the beginning of al fresco dining season, the renowned Healdsburg winery unveils its seasonal “Vine to Table Experience.”

Relax under a wide umbrella while gazing onto the lush lawn and the Russian River Valley. Savor five seasonal dishes, perfectly paired with Rodney Strong’s finest. Taste either the current vintage or the library artisan wines.

Want a taste of the menu? How about roasted beets with rhubarb jam and hints of lavender and hibiscus. Pair that with a 2017 Rosé of Russian River Valley Pinot Noir. Let a butter and vanilla-poached lobster hors d’oeuvre melt in your mouth. The dish comes paired with their elegant Chardonnay. Vegetarian pairings are also available.

Other terrace offerings include a plate of local cheeses and charcuterie chosen by chef Alejandro Garcia. Wine flights include the summertime flight, Pinot lovers and Cabernet Flight, something for everyone’s palate.

As the first carbon-neutral winery in Sonoma County, Rodney Strong Vineyards is committed to sustainability in winemaking as well as its cuisine. The Terrace sources most of its ingredients from either its own garden or local purveyors, such as Marshall’s Farm Honey and Journeyman Meat Co. That means you get a true farm- and vine-to-table experience.
