We all could afford to make more mistakes like this one.

A Michigan lottery player's miscue on a Fantasy 5 betting slip wound up winning him a $100,000 jackpot, according to the Michigan Lottery.

The man from Tuscola County, who chose to remain anonymous, told the Michigan Lottery he usually plays numbers 04-14-28-30-21. Last week, he mistakenly picked 29 instead of 28.

When the numbers were drawn Thursday, they matched his flubbed ticket.

"Rather than starting over with a new slip, I just decided to go ahead and play those numbers and I’m so glad I did," he told the Michigan Lottery.

"Winning the jackpot was all because of a simple mistake, but it’s definitely the best mistake I’ve ever made."

He purchased his ticket at Worth's Party Store at 4730 East Main Street in Millington, Mich.

He said he will put the money toward his mortgage.

"I can’t tell you how it feels to win the jackpot. It’s a once in a lifetime kind of thing," he told the Michigan Lottery.
