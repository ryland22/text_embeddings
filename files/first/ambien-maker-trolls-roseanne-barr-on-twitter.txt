Ambien maker Sanofi Aventis fired back Wednesday at Roseanne Barr after she blamed the sedative for the racist tweetstorm that got her show canceled.

“People of all races, religions and nationalities work at Sanofi every day to improve the lives of people around the world. While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication,” the France-based pharmaceutical company tweeted.

The drugmaker’s response comes hours after Barr wrote that she was “ambien tweeting” when she compared former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to the spawn of “Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes.”

“Guys I did something unforgiveable [sic] so do not defend me. It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting-it was memorial day too-i went 2 far & do not want it defended-it was egregious Indefensible,” the comedian tweeted.

Barr’s Ambien defense was immediately panned on Twitter.

“Does ambient unlock latent racism?” @JeffJSays asked.
