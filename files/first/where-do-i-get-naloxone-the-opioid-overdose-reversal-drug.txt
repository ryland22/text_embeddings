CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Ohio officials have responded to the heroin and fentanyl epidemic by making naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug, available to the public at pharmacies, hospitals, county health boards and other government agencies.

Naloxone, which is also known by its brand name Narcan, is often administered as a nasal spray but can also be injected via a syringe or an auto-injector, similar to an Epi-Pen. Naloxone has no potential for abuse, and does not work on other drugs.

In 2014, Gov. John Kasich signed into law House Bill 170, stripping restrictions that formerly allowed only advanced paramedics and people addicted to prescription opioid drugs or heroin to carry naloxone. First responders including police officers, firefighters and basic paramedics now carry the drug.

Officials also made the drug available to the public. Ohio's Project DAWN, an overdose education and naloxone distribution program, partners with communities to distribute the drug to those who need it. Many counties offer locations -- often the county's health department -- where residents can receive training and naloxone kits at no cost.

In addition, pharmacies including CVS, Discount Drug Mart, Giant Eagle, Marc's, Rite Aid and Walgreens can dispense naloxone without a prescription as long as they follow state regulations. Medicaid, Medicare, and many private insurance companies may cover the cost of naloxone; the cost varies based on the plan.

The state's Board of Pharmacy offers a full list of Ohio pharmacies that offer naloxone, which is searchable by county.

Below is a list of Northeast Ohio government agencies and hospitals that offer naloxone training and kits. The full list of agencies throughout Ohio can be viewed here.
