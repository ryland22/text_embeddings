Embraer announced at the show this morning a follow-on order from German charter operator Air Hamburg for four Embraer 650Es.

Deliveries are scheduled to begin in the second quarter and will continue at a rate of one every three months, the Brazilian airframer says.

The deal comes a year after Air Hamburg became the launch customer for the large-cabin business jet, with an order for three aircraft, all of which have entered service.

Air Hamburg is the largest operator of Embraer Legacy 600-series business jets in the world. Its line-up also includes nine Legacy 650s – the predecessor to the E-variant; two super-midsize Legacy 600s; a pair of Phenom 300 light twins; seven superlight Citation XLSs; two Cessna Citation CJ3s and one CJ2.

The company is expanding into the long-range charter market with an order for a Dassault Falcon 7X. The trijet is scheduled for delivery at the end of the year.

“As the global launch customer of the Legacy 650E, Air Hamburg has proven the success of the aircraft in delivering a superior customer experience,” Embraer Executive Jets president and chief executive Michael Amalfitano said at a dedicated event to mark the signing.

Air Hamburg owner Simon Ebert says he is “eager” to grow its Embraer fleet by 30% “to meet market demand for these popular aircraft”.

The Legacy 650E, with a range of 3,900nm (7,220km), was launched in November 2016 as the next iteration of the six-year old 650. The $26 million aircraft includes a host of features, including a synthetic vision system and autothrottle as standard, a restyled, three-zone interior with full HD in-flight entertainment, and an “unprecedented” 10-year or 10,000-flight-hour warranty. Embraer records a fleet of 70 Legacy 600-series jets in Europe and 260 worldwide.
