Like so many other Jersey Shore towns, Wildwood in Cape May County always brings in police reinforcements when the summer season heats up and the crowds descend on the beaches and the boardwalk.

A small town most of the year, Wildwood’s population of 5,149 soars to 200,000 or more in the summer months, and to handle the crowds, the city's modest police force of about 40 members more than doubles in size after Memorial Day, with the hiring of seasonal “special officers.”

Two of those officers are now the focus of an investigation over their use of force against a woman they attempted to arrest on the beach over the recent holiday weekend, after a video of the arrest went viral.
