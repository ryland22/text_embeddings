Tesla has added incidents to its injury logs after journalist challenged the electric car company's numbers.

Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting said that Tesla reported 13 injuries from 2017 that had not appeared on a legally required report.

In an earlier report called "Insult to Injury," Reveal "found that Tesla has failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports, making the companyâ€™s injury numbers look better than they actually are."

The injuries added after the first Reveal report included "lacerations that made an employee miss more than 100 days of work, a dislocated knee for which a production associate remains out of work and various ergonomic injuries to the hand, wrist, back and shoulder."

"Still, Reveal found Tesla has yet to record all of the 2017 injuries it should have by law. And the company might not face a penalty for it." That's because of an interpretation of the law that means regulators cannot cite employers who fail to record injuries more than 6 months old, Reveal said.
