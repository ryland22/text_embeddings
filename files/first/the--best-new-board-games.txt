Spirit Island

Spirit Island could be a Bizzaro-world sequel to The Settlers of Catan. Instead of colonizing a newfound landmass, you and your friends team up as the invaded isle's guardian spirits. You'll muster the native population, deploy your elemental powers, and work together to frighten, drive, and otherwise murder the invading settlers off your sacred land. Catan fights back, baby!

Wonderfully complex but not excessively complicated, Spirit Island is the best cooperative game of the decade (yes, even better than Pandemic). As spirits, you'll spend your turns building influence on the game board, learning new powers, and picking which ones to use. Meanwhile, the game automates the unceasing advance of the settlers who explore, settle, and ravish new biomes in a set order.

The game includes dozens of ways to modulate the difficulty, but even for the easiest modes require an almost preternatural cleverness; your team needs to know which battles to fight, and to discover the best way to collaborate for maximum fright or damage.
