Roseanne Barr lashed out at her sitcom son Wednesday for throwing her “under the bus” — after he “vehemently” condemned her racist tweetstorm.

Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner in the original series and its 2018 revival, tweeted that Tuesday was “one of the hardest” days in his life and that he was “devastated” — not for the end of the show, but for everyone who “poured their hearts and souls” into it.

“Roseanne” was abruptly canceled by ABC Tuesday, after Barr compared former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett to an ape and called billionaire George Soros a “Nazi” who “turned on his fellow Jews.”

“I condemn these statements vehemently,” Fishman wrote, adding that his character was “designed to represent the inclusive nature of my views.”

But Barr was having none of it.

“I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. Nice!” she responded Wednesday morning.

Barr was more contrite with her TV daughter, actress Sara Gilbert, who played Darlene Conner.

Gilbert called Barr’s comments “abhorrent” and said she was “disappointed in her actions to say the least.”

“This is incredibly sad and difficult for all of us, as we’ve created a show that we believe in, are proud of, and that audiences love— one that is separate and apart from the opinions and words of one cast member,” she wrote.

“Wow! Unreal,” Barr wrote in response, adding, “I understand her position and why she said what she said. I forgive her. It just shocked me a bit, but I indeed f—ed up.”
