Detroit Public Schools Community District will close all schools three hours early on Wednesday due to expected heat, the district announced Wednesday morning.

A statement on the district website said field trips scheduled for today would be rescheduled.

It's the second straight day that DPSCD has closed schools early because of high temperatures. The expected high today in Detroit is 84 degrees, which storms in the late afternoon.

Today, Wednesday, May 30, 2018, all schools will dismiss three (3) hours earlier than the normal dismissal time. The early dismissal is due to high temperatures developing into the afternoon. https://t.co/WYbceJS9Bipic.twitter.com/I8ARbxjonv — DPSCommunityDistrict (@Detroitk12) May 30, 2018
