Sikorsky Firehawk Helicopter Fights Flames in Los Angeles County, California

California’s 2017 wildfire season proved the most destructive on record, when nearly 9,000 wildfires burned 1.2 million acres. The LA County Fire Department fights those fires with the Sikorsky S-70 Firehawk, a variant of the UH-60 Black Hawk. The department has flown the Firehawk since the year 2000 and recently added two S-70i helicopters to its fleet of three S-70As. At the Heli-Expo show, battalion chief Pat Sprengel and senior pilot Mike Sagely explained the capabilities of this multi-role machine.
