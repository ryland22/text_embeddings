FlightGlobal has launched the Aerospace Big Data Conference to serve as the premier industry platform for aircraft manufacturers, maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) providers, suppliers and airlines to come together to debate the hot topics in digital transformation.

Taking place in London on 6-7 December, the day-and-a-half-long conference will comprise a series of panel discussions – moderated by FlightGlobal – examining the business benefits that can be realised through Big Data analytics, as well the key challenges that need to be overcome.

“Aerospace OEMs and MROs are investing heavily in Big Data, but many airlines are yet to be convinced as to why they should share the vast volumes of data being generated by latest generation airliners and their engines,” says FlightGlobal Head of Aerospace, Andrew Doyle.

“The Aerospace Big Data Conference will assemble senior representatives from the major industry players and technology companies, together with key airline decision makers, to determine the size of the prize as well as strategies to overcome obstacles on the path to successful digital transformation,” Doyle adds.
