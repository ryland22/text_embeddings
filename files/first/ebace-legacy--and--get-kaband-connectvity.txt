Embraer has become the first business aircraft manufacturer to offer line-fit, high-capacity, high-speed Ka-band connectivity for midsize business jets, following its selection of Viasat’s Ka-band technology for the Legacy 450 and 500.

Speaking at the show this morning, where the announcement was made, Embraer Executive Jets’ senior vice-president marketing, Luciano Froes, described in-flight connectivity as “a key aspect of the user experience in business aviation”. He notes: “By incorporating innovative technologies, higher performance standards, and premium comfort for a superior flight experience, we are delivering true value to our customers.”

Initial Viasat connectivity service speeds are expected to be 16Mbps, says Embraer, with the potential to increase as Viasat expands its network capacity with additional satellite services. Live TV streaming will also be provided for in-flight entertainment.

The Viasat service will be available for new and existing owners of the Legacy pair from the second quarter of 2019, says Embraer.

The Ka-band offering is one of a host of recent upgrades that Embraer has added to the Legacy 450 and 500, as part of its continuing focus on delivering customer value across its product line.

These enhancements include: restyled passenger seats – which are featured for the first time on the Legacy 450 and 500 on the static; FANS 1/A+ technology in the cockpit, and Gogo's latest air-to-ground connectivity system, AVANCE L5. This feature allows customers to benefit from higher internet speeds through access to 4G networks. The Brazilian airframer has also reduced the cabin altitude for the twinjets.

Legacy 450 and 500s shipped from March have a cabin altitude of 5,800ft – 200ft (60m) lower than their predecessors – when flying at an altitude of 45,000ft.

The Legacy 500 and 450 entered service in 2014 and 2015, respectively. To date the airframer says it has delivered 61 500s and 33 450s.
