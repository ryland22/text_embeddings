Major Food Group — of The Grill, The Lobster Club, Dirty French, Parm and Carbone, to name a few — has launched The Polynesian.

The new tiki bar, in a partnership with Brian Miller, opened at the Pod Hotel at 400 W. 42nd St. over the Memorial Day weekend.

The venue boasts an outdoor terrace with city views, and claims to have the city’s largest rum collection. Offerings include classic cocktails, from a stirred daiquiri and frozen piña colada to an old-fashioned with three rums and a large-format Exotica Bowl, served in a clam shell with dry ice.

The Polynesian seats 100 people inside and 100 people on its outdoor terrace and comes with two bars. Original drinks include the Derelict, Miller’s signature drink of four rums with bourbon, absinthe, lime and grapefruit juices, lilikoi puree, house blend banana liqueur and bitters.
