Lufthansa Technik has become an approved outfitter for the Airbus ACJ350 XWB, and has signed a deal with an undisclosed customer to develop and deliver its new three-in-one-solution (TIOS) radome for installation on a Boeing 737 Max 8.

“To become one of the few approved outfitting centres for the ACJ350 XWB is a very important milestone for our customer acquisition activities regarding completions and modifications for this new aircraft type,” says Wieland Timm, Lufthansa Technik senior director VIP and special mission aircraft.

Lufthansa Technik has already developed and unveiled an ACJ350 XWB VVIP interior concept known as Welcome Home, which includes flexible areas that can be used for either private or family time.

The German maintenance, repair and overhaul provider also announced today that it has signed up its first customer – a “renowned” VIP aircraft completion centre – for its TIOS radome. The first shipset of the radome will be delivered for installation on a 737 Max 8 by the end of 2018.

The TIOS is a triple-band tail-mount solution for the 737 family that can house antennas for L-, Ku- and Ka-band satellite-based in-flight connectivity. In the future the radome will also be adapted for use on the 737 Max 7 and 737 Max 9 aircraft.
