20 Feet and In

Bruce Piatt is one of the top shooters in the world and was a trainer for the New Jersey State Police. He told me everything within 20 feet should be point shooting with a defensive handgun. In a defensive situation, it makes sense to have point-shooting abilities. After-action reports show that, almost without fail, people don’t look at the front sight in a panic situation. Even trained people. Our instinct is to look at the threat. So why not develop that instinct into a usable shooting skill?

If your lizard brain takes over in a panic situation and you focus on the threat, this technique will have given you the skills and muscle memory to make the hit. If you have enough presence of mind to see the sights, so much the better. Either way, you hit the target. Of course, point shooting is also very useful in low-light situations, where seeing the sights can be hard or impossible.

Pick a Spot

The proper way to point shoot is to raise the gun to your normal shooting position. The difference is that you look at the target, focusing on where you want to hit rather than on the sights. It’s important to focus on a specific location rather than the entire target. Like they say, aim small, miss small. So focus on exactly where you want the bullet to strike. The amazing thing is, before long, that’s where the bullet will hit.
