Lenovo’s Z5 promises to be the first true all-screen smartphone – and now the stunner has a release date.

After teasing the Android device on Chinese social media service Weibo, the firm’s VP Chang Cheng just went and dropped its launch invite: the handset will officially arrive on June 5.

Earlier this month, Chang revealed what looked like the bottom half of the smartphone, which has an insane screen-to-body ratio of 95 percent.

Comparably, Apple’s iPhone X has a screen-to-body ratio of 82.9 percent.

Chang also gave everyone a look at a sketch of the entire front of the handset, complete with that remarkable bezel-less design.

And now there’s just over a week till Lenovo takes the wraps off the final product.

Most smartphones are striving to cram in more display by trimming down on borders and sticking the front camera in a love-it-or-hate-it notch.

That’s the panel at the top of the device, which in the case of the iPhone X, houses its TrueDepth camera and sensors that enable face unlock.

While the Lenovo VP has been hyping up the new phone with talk of technological breakthroughs and 18 patented technologies, the device’s official specs are nowhere to be seen.

That leaves some big questions regarding its design, like where the firm will stick the front camera on the all-screen phone.

It could pinch a trick from Chinese rivals Xiaomi and Vivo and either smuggle it into the bottom of the handset (like the Xiaomi Mi Mix and Mi Mix 2) or go with a pop-up camera like the one on the Vivo Apex concept phone.

That’s the same phone that has a fingerprint sensor baked into the screen.

What we do know is that the Lenovo Z5 is being touted as a successor to the now-defunct ZUK line, which the company abandoned after switching its focus to its subsidiary Motorola.
