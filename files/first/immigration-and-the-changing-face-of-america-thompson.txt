Memo to the Republican leadership in Congress: There's no future in bashing immigrants. True, that strategy has proven politically successful for you in the past. But face it guys, the tread's off the tire.

Which is why members of your own party are trying to end run Congressional leadership and force a vote on immigration that would address the legal limbo faced by "Dreamer" immigrants, brought here illegally as children, and who most Americans feel shouldn't be punished for that.

The move may be motivated more by fear of losses in the November midterm elections than by any epiphany about the immorality of demonizing others, but we'll take it.
