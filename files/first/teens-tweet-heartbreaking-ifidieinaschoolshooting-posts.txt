Every few seconds, a teenager in America takes to Twitter, proclaiming fears and final wishes should that life meet a brutal end, cut short in a hail of bullets.

Using the hashtag #IfIDieInASchoolShooting, thousands of high school kids have shared their angst in the wake of yet another massacre at a school — this time in Santa Fe, Texas — all humbled by the reality that the next teens to be slaughtered by a gunman could be them.

Among the refrains: Donate my organs. Don't stop fighting for more stringent gun control laws. Lay my body on the steps of the White House, the Capitol or the National Rifle Association headquarters. Don't forget me.

Between Sunday and Tuesday afternoon, there had been 69,000 mentions of #IfIDieInASchoolShooting on Twitter, a spokeswoman told the Free Press. Many of those Tweets also included the #NeverAgain hashtag, which has been used more than 5.7 million times since February.

Lauren Belcher, an 18-year-old senior at Henry Ford II High School in Sterling Heights, was among the high schoolers who felt inspired to tweet using the hashtag.

She tweeted: "#IfIDieInaSchoolShooting Remember me for what I did, not how I died. I hope to leave a legacy one day. But not now. Not yet. I'm not ready. At the same time, politicize my death. Fight for me. I won't be able to anymore. Let them know your anger. Don't back down. Spread love."

Belcher, who plans to study at Macomb Community College in the fall and hopes to one day become a school psychologist, said the students who rose up in protest after the February shooting in Parkland, Florida, inspired her to be more vocal about her views.

"I wanted to show my support and show everyone how devastating it truly is," she said. "I wanted people who know me to understand what I hope for them to do if I end up being a victim of a shooting.

"I am so disappointed about what’s happening in our country. ... Students should not be afraid to attend school each day in fear of the possibility of being killed. Children should not have to worry about how they should defend themselves in that situation. We shouldn’t have to be fighting for our lives. ... The government should care more about us, not guns."

Ten people died Friday in a shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas; 13 more were injured. Seventeen were killed in February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Twenty-six — including 20 children — lost their lives in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. That tally doesn't include the dozens of shootings on college campuses, concerts, movie theaters or the carnage that was the start of it all in 1999 at Columbine High School in Colorado.

None of them will ever see another sunrise, hug their mothers or fathers, sisters or brothers again. The thought was unbearable to Andrew Schneidawind, 18, a college sophomore in Virginia who told Teen Vogue he lives in fear every day of a mass shooting.

So he started on Sunday the hashtag #IfIDieInASchoolShooting, hoping it would go viral.

It did.

Here's a look at a few of the tweets:
