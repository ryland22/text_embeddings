A Brief Guide to Using Finish Nailers

Align the Nail



As you near the end of a piece of molding, turn the nailer so its body is parallel to the wood's grain. This fires the nail so it wedges itself in across the grain rather than splitting it.

Set the Depth

Use the depth-adjustment wheel to set how far into the wood your tool will drive the nail. You want a cavity just deep enough to hold a tiny glop of wood filler. Too deep and the filler won't fill the hole; too shallow and the filler won't stay put. Fire some nails into a test block to try it first.

Tip

Gluing wood in place before nailing can vastly improve your nail-gun experience, but only if you use glue specified as quick-tack. (Most carpenter's and wood glues will fill the bill.) If you use a white glue instead, you'll end up with trim that slides aroundâ€” and possibly a nail in your finger.
