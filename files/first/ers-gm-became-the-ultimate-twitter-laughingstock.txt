On a night when a general manager was accused of having five burner accounts on Twitter, there was no better place to be than Twitter.

Everyone from Joel Embiid, fellow general managers and teams from other sports came swooping in to have some fun at the expense of Bryan Colangelo on Tuesday night. The 76ers president and GM allegedly leaked sensitive information and trashed some of his own players through the burner accounts, according to a report from The Ringer.

One of the players criticized by the alleged burner accounts, Embiid, didn’t hold back.

“BRUH,” he tweeted, with a picture of him from draft night. The photo conveniently included Embiid in a collar. One of the burner accounts defending Colangelo’s super-size collars was one of the more hilarious moments of the evening.

“Joel told me that @samhinkie IS BETTER AND SMARTER THAN YOU @AlVic40117560 #BurnerAccount,” Embiid tweeted later.

Embiid, who went back and liked some of the burner account’s tweets about him, later said he didn’t believe the story because “that would just be insane.”

A few of Colangelo’s counterparts didn’t stay on the sideline, either.

“You need two blue checks to confirm you are not a burner,” Rockets GM Daryl Morey tweeted in response to an SB Nation blog saying they were not Morey’s burner account.

Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who is active from his own account, followed that up by citing the “Twitter Posting Agreement,” playing off the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

“Actually , that was back in the day,” Cuban said while quote-tweeting Morey’s joke. “As of the new TPA (Twitter Posting Agreement) every NBA exec gets assigned 7 burner accounts. Let me know if I can help you get a 🔥for your accounts. BTW, loved your burner account names. @moreymeister is my fave. #FeelTheBurn”

Celtics GM Danny Ainge poked fun, too, responding with just a “shh” emoji when a user tweeted that a Celtics fan account must be his burner.

By Wednesday morning, the Timberwolves tweeted a video of them deleting a burner account from their phone. They, ironically, deleted the tweet.

The reaction wasn’t contained to just basketball circles. The Tampa Bay Rays tweeted they had no burner accounts; the Oakland Athletics joked that they had to “unclick burner accounts” before completing their own double play; and the Colorado Rockies tweeted a message meant to be from a burner account.
