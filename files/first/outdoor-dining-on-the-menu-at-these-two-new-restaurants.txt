Summer in the city calls for patios across the boroughs.

L’Appart launches Jardin Privé, its 15-seat patio, on May 29. The Michelin-starred restaurant, famously designed to look like a cozy apartment, will now spill out onto a terrace that’s planted with flowers and herbs used by Executive Chef Nico Abello — from morning glories and moonflowers to mint, fennel, lemon verbena, lemon grass, tarragon and rosemary.

Offerings from the venue inside Le District at 225 Liberty St. include a $200 caviar flight, a tasting menu of three Sturia caviars with a pairing of Champagne, Riesling and Gray Goose for an additional $60.

There’s also a new rooftop lounge named RFTP, at the Pod Brooklyn Hotel in Williamsburg.

The lounge, at 247 Metropolitan Ave., seats 100 people — 200 including the private party space — and boasts views from Brooklyn to the Manhattan skyline. It features a zinc bar and cushioned wooden “banquettes.”

Dishes include a South-of-France style “vegetable garden” with seasonal veggies like baby carrot, radish and Romanesco broccoli. The dish also includes “edible soil” that will be quinoa based, with a touch of black olive and burnt leek powder to resemble dirt.

The menu also includes an artichoke dip with cauliflower, garlic confit, seared fontina, pita chips; charcuterie; and paratha flatbread with feta, figs, arugula and balsamic.

Drinks include on-trend frosé, an RFTP spritz and Modelo on tap.
