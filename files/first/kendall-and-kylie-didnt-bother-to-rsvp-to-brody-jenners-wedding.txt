Brody Jenner’s Kardashian half-sisters were too busy to entertain the idea of attending his wedding.

“Kendall and Kylie didn’t even bother to RSVP” to Brody and blogger Kaitlynn Carter’s Bali-based festivities, an insider told Page Six.

Page Six previously reported that Brody’s dad, Caitlyn, 68, was skipping the wedding trip due to scheduled work commitments. His mom, Linda Thompson, and brother Brandon Jenner are celebrating with him instead.

It is unclear why Kendall, 22, or Kylie, 21, couldn’t make it to Brody’s special day, but Kylie and baby daddy Travis Scott were spotted courtside at the Houston Rockets game on Monday. Kendall spent a “low key” Memorial Day with Kourtney Kardashian and friends.

The couple is set set to tie the knot in Sumba Island at Nihi Sumba but “there is an LA reception that’s going to be planned, so maybe that’ll be different,” the insider added.
