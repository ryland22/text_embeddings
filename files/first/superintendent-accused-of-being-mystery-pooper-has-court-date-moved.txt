The Kenilworth School District superintendent accused of pooping daily near the Holmdel High School running track was scheduled to appear in court May 30 but that hearing has been delayed.

Thomas Tramaglini, on paid leave through June 30 from his $147,504 a year job, is now scheduled to appear in Holmdel Municipal Court on June 12 for charges of public urination/defecation, littering and lewdness. The charges are low-level offenses and Tramaglini likely will just be subjected to pay fines.

Tramaglini's attorney, Matthew S. Adams, pointed out that it's a very common practice for early hearings to be moved to accommodate both parties.

Adams, a defense attorney with Morristown-based Fox Rothschild, has previously said that Tramaglini looks forward to rebutting "some of the falsehoods that have been portrayed about him in the media." Adams has not said what information was incorrect.

According to Holmdel police, officials "monitored" the area and were able to identify Tramaglini as the person responsible for defecating on the track daily.

According to the arrest report, there are two DVDs with surveillance video footage of the crime. The township hasn't released the footage, saying it could compromise the school's "security measures and surveillance techniques."

What's not known is why someone would relieve themselves at the school multiple times.

Tramaglini was arrested at 5:45 a.m. on May 1 while he was running on the track at the high school.
