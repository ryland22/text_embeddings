The newest open-world game from developer Ubisoft is due to be release on March 27. Far Cry 5 looks be something quite different, as it takes place in fictional Hope County, Montana. A preacher there named Joseph Seed has risen to prominence. Seed believes that he has been chosen to protect the people of Hope County from an "inevitable collapse" and has established a congregation called Eden's Gate. Ostensibly, this is to fulfill his mission of leading the people to salvation;[9] in reality, Seed is a radical preacher and Eden's Gate is a militaristic doomsday cult. The setting provides the opportunity for players to interact with a host of wildlife, such as a dog that will fetch guns from bad guys for you, or even bears who you can make do your bidding.

From the gameplay trailer, it looks like there is an impressive host of firearms as well. At one point, you even get to use a compound bow. The FPS game also offers a bunch of changes from previous entries in the series. You can recruit locals to help you on your tasks, tame wild animals, customize your character, and even create maps of your own with an included map editor. Check out the trailer above and wait to see our coverage of the guns of Far Cry 5 once the game is released.
