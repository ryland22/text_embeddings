Here’s an opportunity to invest in some surreal estate.

In Miami, a roughly 2,552-square-foot property named Villa Paula will hit the market for $4.5 million as part of a four-lot commercial assemblage. Also included: a bunch of ghost stories, as Villa Paula — once a Cuban consulate — is reportedly the most haunted home in Magic City.

Over the years, residents and visitors have reported bizarre encounters with spirits inside the neoclassical building, which dates to 1926 and stands at 5811 North Miami Ave. in Little Haiti.

One of them, a Cuban fashion designer named Fernando Garcia — who briefly rented Villa Paula just over a decade ago — told the Biscayne Times that, while seated at a desk, a windowpane fell from a frame behind him. When he stood up to check it out, a 40-pound block of plaster suddenly fell from the ceiling to the spot where he had just been sitting.

“If I hadn’t moved when I did, I would be dead,” he told the publication. Biscayne Times’ Terence Cantarella added that Villa Paula had earned “its reputation as Miami’s most haunted home.”

It’s said that five spirits occupy the building.

One of them is Paula Milord — the wife of Cuban consul Domingo Milord, for whom the building was named — who died in 1932 from complications stemming from a leg amputation. (Although there’s a grave in Villa Paula’s backyard marked with her name, sources tell The Post she was actually buried elsewhere. Rumors flew that she died in one of the home’s bedrooms, but it’s since been discovered she actually passed away in a local hospital.)

There’s also the alleged spirit of an infant said to be the illegitimate child of a house servant. The baby’s mother is yet another roaming ghost, per the Biscayne Times, in search of the child’s grave.

The building is currently used as an art gallery. Paranormal activity doesn’t bother some of its present-day occupants.

“I don’t particularly believe in ghosts,” says artist Joe Chirichigno, who’s had studio space at Villa Paula since 2014 and says nothing has ever frightened him while inside.

But Chirichigno has observed the strange experiences of villa visitors, including psychics and paranormal investigators, who have knocked on his door at random over the years in order to gain access to the building. Two separate teams, for example, were drawn to the bathroom where the baby allegedly died. Chirichigno recalls they told him, “There’s the spirit of a dead baby in here.”

Then, a psychic medium who came to visit while Chirichigno was working, channeled the spirit of Paula, who wanted to convey a message to him.

The psychic “had this grip on my hands and said, ‘I love you, I love what you’ve done to the place,’ ” he says. “ ‘This house had a very important part in my life, and I love that you brought it back to life.’ ”

Villa Paula’s building materials were all imported from Cuba, and additional features include 18-foot ceilings and a gazebo that stands in a lush garden. Photos of the property show interiors that have been well-preserved, with big windows and columns.

But the spooky notoriety adds another level to the property.

“I think it’s a plus,” says Jean-Louis Delbeke of ONE Sotheby’s International Realty, who will represent the building — adding he doesn’t believe in the paranormal personally and hasn’t felt anything off during his visits. He says the haunting is something that could be parlayed into, say, a supernatural-themed restaurant.

“I’m sure people would love that,” Delbeke says. “A lot of the time, none of these ghosts are frightening.”
