Naples-style pizza is coming to the Meatpacking District.

SIMÒ Pizza will open at 90-92 Gansevoort St. in June as a fast-casual venue, with personal pizzas priced at $10 or under.

Diners will order and pay at the counter by credit card — no cash accepted. Diners will then be given a number labeled on a pepper mill filled with red chili flakes, and seat themselves at communal marble tables. From there, it’s full-table service.

SIMÒ Pizza is from Simone Falco, the executive chef and owner of Rossopomodoro, more of a fine dining pizzeria experience with locations in the West Village and at Eataly.

The menu will feature six pizzas including vegetarian and vegan options, and three salads. The 1,300-square-foot space seats 20 people.

The simple drinks menu will feature one white wine, one red wine, one prosecco, one beer option, and Italian sodas.
