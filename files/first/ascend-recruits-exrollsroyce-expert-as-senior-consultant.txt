Flightglobal's consultancy arm Ascend has appointed Richard Evans as senior consultant.

Evans will work on advisory and valuations projects across the whole commercial aviation sector. He joins after 27 years with Rolls-Royce, where – most recently as head of market analysis within the civil aerospace division – he studied major trends for airlines and operating lessors, in addition to advising on business-improvement activities undertaken by the engine maker.

As an airline and aerospace expert, Evans has frequently presented at or chaired international conferences, including for Routes.

With Evans' recruitment, Ascend's consultancy team is now 23-strong.

"I am delighted to see an industry analyst of Richard's calibre further strengthening our team," says Ascend head of consultancy Rob Morris. "We are looking forward to Richard's contribution to Ascend Flightglobal Consultancy and for our customers to benefit from his wealth of knowledge and insight to the aviation market."
