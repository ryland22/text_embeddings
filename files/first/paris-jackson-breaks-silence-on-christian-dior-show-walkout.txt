Paris Jackson admitted she made a hasty exit from a Christian Dior fashion show last week because she didn’t approve of the brand’s use of animals in their presentation.

“To be clear, I did not ‘storm out’ of the show,” Jackson, 20, tweeted Tuesday. “I quietly got up and walked out trying my hardest to not cause a scene, because I do not support animals being branded and whipped. Not trying to become enemies in the fashion world in any way, but I will always be myself.”

Sources previously told Page Six that the late King of Pop‘s It Girl daughter left in a huff after seeing the first model hit the catwalk and went outside to prance around in puddles outside.

The show reportedly featured a re-creation of a “Mexican rodeo with all-female riders performing daredevil stunts,” which insiders told us offended the starlet.
