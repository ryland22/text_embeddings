Kendall Jenner is dating Philadelphia 76er Ben Simmons, multiple sources tell Page Six exclusively.

An insider familiar with the duo said the romance has been going on “for a few weeks.”

Another source told us the pair was spotted this week on a lunch date at the Beverly Hills Hotel. And a third source said that Jenner, 22, and Simmons, 21, were seen last week in Manhattan with a group of friends at the clubby Bowery restaurant Vandal.

“Security measures seemed to have been taken to ensure Kendall and Ben enjoyed their night hassle free,” said a witness. “They were smiling the night away with their friends.”

Supermodel and reality star Jenner is rebounding from another NBA star — former LA Clippers player Blake Griffin, who was traded to the Detroit Pistons. The pair was seen avoiding each other last month at music festival Coachella.

Jenner spent Memorial Day weekend taking sexy bikini pictures with her sister Kourtney Kardashian, but then met on Tuesday with the 6-foot-10 point guard Simmons.

On Monday, Simmons was seen arriving at LAX, and told TMZ he’d be up for playing with LeBron James amid rumors that King James could leave the Cavaliers after this season and move to Philly to join its burgeoning team of talented young stars. When asked if he could play with James, Rookie of the Year candidate Simmons said, “There’s only one way to find out.”

Simmons was previously linked to singer Tinashe after a flirty interaction on social media.

Jenner, meanwhile, keeps her romances very private. She allegedly also dated ASAP Rocky, and she addressed speculation in a recent Vogue article by saying, “I don’t think I have a bisexual or gay bone in my body, but I don’t know! Who knows?! I’m all down for experience — not against it whatsoever — but I’ve never been there before.”

Reps did not immediately get back to us to comment.
