An archeologist discovered a green, mummified baby hand attached to a not-so-mummified skeleton, with bones so small it could have been mistaken for a rat. By investigating its origin and history, researchers not only uncovered a story, but a rare new form of mummification.

Researchers stumbled upon the hand in a box after an excavation of a cemetery in Nyárlőrinc, a village in southern Hungary. The had yielded over 500 graves from between the 12th and 16th centuries, but the mummy hand stood alone. It wasn’t the first time archaeologists uncovered green boned skeletons: copper and bronze jewelry can discolor skeletons, so it was likely that the child’s body contacted some kind of metal. But why was it in its hand? “It’s not so obvious, and it’s so unlikely that you’re questioning yourself,” Dr. Balázs, author of a study published in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, told the New York Times.

When the archeologists analyzed the remains, they found that the tiny skeleton had the highest copper levels ever seen in a mummy — hundreds of times higher than average. To solve its mystery, they looked to other objects found in the same dig: a small ceramic pot and corroded copper coin. The team concluded that someone put the coin into the child’s hand, an ancient tradition to to protect the dead’s soul and safely ferry them to the afterlife. The copper preserved the hand from decay, and may be one of the first reported cases of copper-mummification.

“They kind of succeeded at saving not necessarily the soul, but some kind of legacy of this little kid,” said Dr. Bereczki, “here we are still talking about the baby and the circumstances of its burial 150 years later.”
