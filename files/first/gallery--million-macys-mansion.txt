Details

Fountains, livestock-filled pastures and Greco-Roman statues fill the one-of-a-kind property.

Cobble Close, designed by noted architect Alfred Hopkins, took eight years to construct and was such a large project that a separate train line was devised to deliver the materials, many of which were transported from Europe.

The property, once a working "gentleman's dairy farm," has a star-studded past. Nadia Gray, known for her coffee table strip tease in the 1960 Federico Fellini film "La Dolce Vita," is among the previous tenants. Cobble Close has been featured in several commercials, Vogue magazine and served as the backdrop for a Victoria's Secret catalog.

Property highlights include a 12-stall parking garage, classical-style pool, cabanas and several connected buildings.
