Tucked away behind a wrought-iron gate and a stone wall encased in ivy in the expensive enclave of Hillsborough sits 640 Brewer Drive, a six-bedroom, 6.5-bath vine-covered French Tudor that looks like a fairytale chateau come to life.

Built in 1930, the 7,344-square-foot property still has many of its original features, according to the marketing website. “Original architecture presents itself in a carved stone fireplace, French doors, antique wallpaper and Venetian plastered walls,” it reads.

The floor-to-ceiling walnut-paneled library is pretty spectacular as well. We also love the arched doorway into the formal living room that mimics the ornate wood-carved front door.

Some other areas have been updated, of course, including the kitchen, which continues the European country estate theme found in the rest of the home with custom French cabinets, butcher block island and a fireplace in the breakfast nook.

The master bedroom has also been modernized with some unique touches, including what the listing site refers to as a “shower in the round.” It has a curved glass surround, domed ceiling and multiple shower heads.

You’ll find more one-of-a-kind amenities outside on the .83-acre grounds, like the pickle ball court and putting green (with sandtrap). There’s also an oval-shaped pool with an adorable pool house whose exterior makes it look like a “mini me” of the main home.

Plus, what would a fairy tale home be without a secret rose garden? This one does not disappoint. It is accessed by via a cobblestone walkway off the similarly-paved driveway and surrounded by manicured boxwoods. Behind the gate, festooned with flowers, there’s a primly landscaped garden of hedges and roses, with an an antique statue at the center.

Even a run-of-the-mill home in Hillsborough costs a pretty penny, so it should be no surprise that this magical mansion is asking $10.9 million. If you happen to have a fairy godmother, now is the time to ring her up.
