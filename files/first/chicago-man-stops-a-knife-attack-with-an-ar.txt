Wait a minute! I thought guns were only reserved for nut jobs who like to shoot innocent people?! You mean to tell me that you can also use them for hunting, self-defense or to diffuse a situation?

Yes. That’s exactly what guns are truly used for, and one suburban Chicago man proved it on Monday.

Oswego, Ill. resident Dave Thomas witnessed a person with a knife attack another person during a heated exchange, so Thomas did what he thought was right and successfully attempted to break up the altercation because it was right outside his door at the apartment complex he lives in.

According to WGN, Thomas said the following concerning the ordeal:

I poked my head out the door. There was a pool of blood, blood was everywhere in the hall. There was still a confrontation going on, there were about three or four people involved at this point. So I ran back into my house and grabbed my AR-15. I grabbed the AR-15 over my handgun -- bigger gun, I think a little more of an intimidation factor. Definitely played a part in him actually stopping.

The knife-wielding suspect did leave the scene, only to be picked up by police shortly thereafter.

WGN also reported that Thomas does have a “valid firearm owner’s identification card and a concealed carry permit.”

Thomas told WGN of how the highly disputed ownership of AR-15’s can be a benefit to law-abiding citizens.

“The AR-15 is my weapon of choice for home protection," Thomas said. "It's light, it's maneuverable. If you train and know how to use it properly, it's not dangerous. And this is just a perfect example of good guy with an AR-15 stopped a bad guy with a knife. And there were no lives taken, so all in all it was a good day.”

It’s easy to debunk a narrative when that narrative is based in fiction.
