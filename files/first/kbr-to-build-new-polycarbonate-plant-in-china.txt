US-based KBR has received a licence and engineering (LBED) and an equipment supply contract from chemicals manufacturer Cangzhou Dahua New Materials (CDNM) to construct a new polycarbonate plant in Cangzhou City, China.

The firms intend to initially build the plant as a single train facility having a capacity of 100,000mt per annum, with plans to expand to 200,000mt in the future.

Under the contract, KBR will supply its phosgene-based interfacial polycarbonate PCMAX technology, along with basic engineering design package and equipment for the plant.



CDNM chairman Xie Huasheng said: “The polycarbonate market in China is booming, and we believe that by choosing KBR’s advanced technology, we can achieve the best quality of products and place ourselves in the leading position in this new market.”

“The polycarbonate market in China is booming.”

KBR licences and designs polycabonate synthesis and compounding plants, as well as complementary phenolic technologies such as phenol/acetone and bisphenol-A (BPA).

KBR technology and consulting president John Derbyshire said: “We are extremely pleased and honoured to be CDNM’s strategic partner.

“China is one of our most important markets and KBR is excited to be a part of this significant project.”

Last month, the firm received a contract from Indorama Eleme Fertilizer & Chemicals and Toyo Engineering for the Train 2 ammonia plant that is being planned to be built at Indorama’s Port Harcourt site in Nigeria.

The contract requires KBR to provide technology licensing, basic engineering design, equipment and catalyst for the plant.
