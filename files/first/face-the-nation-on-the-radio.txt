Rated 5 out of 5 by MMNN from All around great show I look forward to this podcast every week. It helps to keep me up to date with events and politics. I enjoy hearing Bob's editorial halfway though the show. He is articulate and brings a great element to the show.

Rated 5 out of 5 by MaRK from Quiet confident interviews The week is highlighted in this interview based news show. I tune it in at my convenience with Stitcher to get a thorough presentation by a key player in the news with shouting and obfuscating.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Hastan12 from Great show Always a wonderful and intellectually stimulating show about current events. Have either watched or listened to this show for many years.

Rated 5 out of 5 by verna123 from My favorite news show Bob Schieffer is a genius for having controversial guests and still maintaining polite order. Not a shouting match like most

Rated 4 out of 5 by joem from always good An iportant sunday news show. Very good but Bob Schieffer goes a bit soft on many interviewees

Rated 4 out of 5 by Atxzen from Informative & entertaining I enjoy the direct & common sense approach, rather than partisan spin.
