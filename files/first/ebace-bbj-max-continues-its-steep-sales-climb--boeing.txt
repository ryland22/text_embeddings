Boeing Business Jets has made a strong start to the year with four new orders so far, including two for the BBJ version of the 737 Max, BBJ chief executive Greg Laxton said at EBACE this morning.

However, Boeing has got some way to go to match last year’s tally of 16.

The two BBJ Max sales add to a backlog of 19, leading Boeing to claim that the re-engined narrowbody variant is becoming “one of the best-selling business jetliners in history”.

Boeing delivered the first BBJ Max 8 in April and says several more examples will be handed over in the coming months.

Laxton says the cabin size of the BBJ Max family, coupled with its range of 7,000nm (12,970km), give it an advantage over competitors.

“The performance advantage of the BBJ Max is a big sales driver,” he says. “The airplane is perfectly suited for discerning customers who want to fly farther without stopping.”

Boeing set up its dedicated division for business jets in 1996 and since then has taken 259 orders and delivered 233 aircraft. Its backlog stands at 19 737 Max aircraft, four BBJ 737s and three 787s.
