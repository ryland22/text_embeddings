Tens of thousands of New Jersey high school seniors will graduate in the coming weeks and look forward to starting college in the fall.

But some will not last more than a year at their college or university.

About 15 percent of full-time freshmen at New Jersey's four-year colleges dropped out, went part-time or transferred before their sophomore year, according to the most recent state data.

In many cases, the colleges with the lowest freshman retention rates are those with the most low-income students, who often come least prepared for college and have no financial safety net.

That isn't so much a reflection on a college itself as it is the students it serves, college officials say.

At Bloomfield College, which has a mission to reach low-income students, first-year students commonly switch to part-time because they need to work or decide to transfer to a community college, president Richard Levao said.

"It's not because they can't complete college," Levao said. "It's because their path to success is a broken path. They go part-time, they go full-time, they go to one school, they go to another."

Here's the list of New Jersey four-year colleges with the worst freshman retention rate among full-time, first-year students in the fall of 2015. The list does not include for-profit colleges or colleges with fewer than 200 freshmen.
