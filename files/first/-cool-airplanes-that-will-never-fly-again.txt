Where It Is Now and Why...

The Spruce Goose was the biggest airplane ever built in its day, and it is still the longest-winged airplane of all time, with a span of 321 feet. It weighed 250,000 pounds empty and had a payload of 150,000 pounds, a figure no plane before it came close to. The 'Goose didn't actually fly until after the war was over, and even then it only flew once. Many believe it never truly "flew" but just rose up in ground effect. Still, few question whether or not it could fly. The test hop was impressively stable. After its first (and at the same time its last) flight, the H-4 was retired to a specially constructed hangar where hundreds of workers kept it in flying shape, though it never did fly again. Later it was moved to Long Beach Harbor, where it was on display next to the Queen Mary for years. Today the Spruce Goose makes its home at Evergreen Aviation Museum in McMinnville, Oregon. It is so large the museum itself would have to be torn down to set the Spruce Goose free.
