New Jersey residents are buying, and buying fast.

Housing inventory in New Jersey dropped 11 percent between March 2017 and March 2018, according to data from Zillow. Even as prices rise slowly or remain stagnant statewide, residents are snapping up available housing, lowering the average time on the market and signaling potential price rises ahead.

"Houses here are selling much quicker than usual," said Dominie Healey, a booker associate for Vikki Healey Realtors in Hackensack. "It's coming onto the radar as a nice place to live, and there's the anticipation of development coming in the future."

But she agrees that inventory is "down all over." She's also noticed investors taking a more aggressive stance in the market.

These towns had the biggest drop in inventory between spring 2016 and spring 2018. Find out the towns where people are gobbling up houses the quickest. And if you're looking, you better get 'em while you can.

A note about the data: Based on Zillow for-sale inventory averages between April 2016 and March 2017 compared with April 2017 to March 2018. Markets with less than 50 houses in inventory were excluded.
