Brooke Shields loves the skin she’s in.

The 52-year-old actress recently showed off her bod in an ad campaign for swimwear brand Swimsuits For All.

“At 52 years old, I finally feel comfortable and proud of all the hard work I’ve put into my body,” she tells People.

But the mother of two says it took a long journey for her to accept her body.

“Growing up under such scrutiny led me to feel insecure about my looks,” Shields says. “Feeling disconnected from my own body, it took me years to separate the opinions of others from my own.

“Over time, I was able to find confidence in myself through my work, my passions, my network of strong female role models and my journey through motherhood.”

And she’s not one for crash diets, either.

“It’s all about balance. There’s no set way to be healthy and fit, it really is finding what works for you,” she says. “I always try to drink a lot of water, get a good night’s sleep and maintain a healthy and active lifestyle.”
